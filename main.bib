The first assumption is consistent with numerous experimental results, and we test the second with an alternative assumption: that the convection velocity fluctuations are Gaussian. The two models are found to agree well up to moderately high fluctuation levels, thus giving support for Lmnley's model in atmospheric boundary layer applications. We generalize his model to spectra of lateral velocity and a scalar, and calculate how various large-wavenumber spectral properties are disturbed by convection velocity fluctuations. The inertial subrange spectra are found to be affected relatively little, but serious spectral distortion is found at l...},

Users can access the database through an interface that is based on the Web services model and perform numerical experiments on the slightly over 100 terabytes (TB) DNS data on their remote platforms, such as laptops or local desktops.

abstract = {In this paper, we address the problem of how to account for second-order statistics of turbulent flows using low-complexity stochastic dynamical models based on the linearized Navier–Stokes equations. The complexity is quantified by the number of degrees of freedom in the linearized evolution model that are directly influenced by stochastic excitation sources. For the case where only a subset of velocity correlations are known, we develop a framework to complete unavailable second-order statistics in a way that is consistent with linearization around turbulent mean velocity. In general, white-in-time stochastic forcing is not sufficient to explain turbulent flow statistics. We develop models for coloured-in-time forcing using a maximum entropy formulation together with a regularization that serves as a proxy for rank minimization. We show that coloured-in-time excitation of the Navier–Stokes equations can also be interpreted as a low-rank modification to the generator of the linearized dynamics. Our method provides a data-driven refinement of models that originate from first principles and captures complex dynamics of turbulent flows in a way that is tractable for analysis, optimization and control design.},

Except in the buffer layer, where the convection velocities are reasonably constant, considerable variations in Uc are observed, both with respect to the distance from the wall and the scale of the event. The largest-scale motions (of the order of the boundary layer thickness) are convected at velocities close to the local mean. However, the velocities drop significantly as the scales are reduced for all types of events studied. Hence, the concept of a unique structure convection velocity does not appear to be very useful, since it must depend on the state of evolution of the structure. The propagation velocity also appears to be different for different parts of the event. It is found that for all scales and positions, the convection velocity for ejections is distinctly lower than that for sweeps, suggesting that the mechanisms responsible for the...},

Recent work on initial value problems has suggested that nonmodal growth of perturbations may be of equal and perhaps greater importance, at least in cases of rapid development. Examples of robust growth in model problems which support no instabilities and in baroclinic flows with realistic Ekman damping for which the exponential modes have zero or negative growth rates have been shown. Such examples have focused attention on the perturbations which are configured to tap the energy of mean flows. Here a critical examination of these favorably configured perturbations is given, making use of the simple constant free shear barotropic model which allows construction of exact two-dimensional isolated wave packet solutions.},

abstract = {We investigate energy amplification in parallel channel flows, where background noise is modeled as stochastic excitation of the linearized Navier–Stokes equations. We show analytically that the energy of three-dimensional streamwise-constant disturbances achieves O(R3) amplification. Our basic technical tools are explicit analytical calculations of the traces of solutions of operator Lyapunov equations, which yield the covariance operators of the forced random velocity fields. The dependence of these quantities on both the Reynolds number and the spanwise wave number are explicitly computed. We show how the amplification mechanism is due to a coupling between wall-normal velocity and vorticity disturbances, which in turn is due to nonzero mean shear and disturbance spanwise variation. This mechanism is viewed as a consequence of the non-normality of the dynamical operator, and not necessarily due to the existence of near resonances or modes with algebraic growth.},

@article{deKat2015,
abstract = {Spatial turbulence spectra for high-Reynolds-number shear flows are usually obtained by mapping experimental frequency spectra into wavenumber space using Taylor's hypothesis, but this is known to be less than ideal. In this paper, we propose a cross-spectral approach that allows us to determine the entire wavenumber–frequency spectrum using two-point measurements. The method uses cross-spectral phase differences between two points – equivalent to wave velocities – to reconstruct the wavenumber–frequency plane, which can then be integrated to obtain the spatial spectrum. We verify the technique on a particle image velocimetry (PIV) data set of a turbulent boundary layer. To show the potential influence of the different mappings, the transfer functions that we obtained from our PIV data are applied to hot-wire data at approximately the same Reynolds number. Comparison of the newly proposed technique with the classic approach based on Taylor's hypothesis shows that – as expected – Taylor's hypothesis holds for larger wavenumbers (small spatial scales), but there are significant differences for smaller wavenumbers (large spatial scales). In the range of Reynolds number examined in this study, double-peaked spectra in the outer region of a turbulent wall flow are thought to be the result of using Taylor's hypothesis. This is consistent with previous studies that focused on examining the limitations of Taylor's hypothesis (del {\'{A}}lamo & Jim{\'{e}}nez, J. Fluid Mech. , vol. 640, 2009, pp. 5–26). The newly proposed mapping method provides a data-driven approach to map frequency spectra into wavenumber spectra from two-point measurements and will allow the experimental exploration of spatial spectra in high-Reynolds-number turbulent shear flows.},

Above the viscous wall layer, the hairpin vortex paradigm of Theodorsen coupled with the quasistreamwise vortex paradigm have gained considerable support from multidimensional visualization using particle image velocimetry and direct numerical simulation experiments. Hairpins can autogenerate to form packets that populate a significant fraction of the boundary layer, even at very high Reynolds numbers. The dynamics of packet formation and the ramifications of organization of coherent structures (hairpins or packets) into larger-scale structures are discussed. Evidence for a large-scale mechanism in the outer layer suggests that further organization of packets may occur on scales equal to and larger than the boundary layer thickness.},

It is apparent that the approach to an asymptotically high–Reynolds number state is slow, but at a sufficiently high Reynolds number the log law remains a fundamental part of the mean flow description. With regard to the coherent motions, very-large-scale motions or superstructures exist at all Reynolds numbers, but they become increasingly important with Reynolds number in terms of their energy content and their interaction with the smaller scales near the wall. There is accumulating evidence that certain features are flow specific, such as the constants in the log law and the behavior of the very large scales and their interaction with the large scales (consisting of vortex packets). Moreover, the refined attached-eddy hypothesis continues to provide an important theoretical framework for the structure of wall-bounded turbulent flows.},

The linearized problem for the wall normal velocity is first solved in the limit of small viscosity for a uniform shear and for a channel with turbulent-like profile, and compared with the quasiperiodic bursting of fully turbulent simulations in boxes designed to be minimal for the logarithmic layer. Many properties, such as time and length scales, energy fluxes between components, and inclination angles, agree well between the two systems. However, once advection by the mean flow is subtracted, the directly computed linear component of the turbulent acceleration is found to be a small part of the total. The temporal correlations of the different quantities in turbulent bursts imply that the classical model, in which the wall-normal velocities are generated by the breakdown of the streamwise-velocity streaks, is ...},

abstract = {The scale-dependent turbulent convection velocity of streamwise velocity fluctuations resolved by large eddy simulation is investigated for the first time across the whole profile of a zero-pressure-gradient spatially developing smooth flat plate boundary layer at $\mathit{Re}_{{\it\theta}}=13\,000$ . The high Reynolds number and streamwise heterogeneity constraints motivate the derivation of a dedicated new method to assess the frequency-dependent convection velocity from time signals and their local streamwise derivative, using estimates of power spectral densities (PSDs). This method is inspired by del {\'{A}}lamo & Jim{\'{e}}nez ( J. Fluid Mech. , vol. 640, 2009, pp. 5–26), who treated a lower Reynolds number channel flow with a method suited to spectral direct numerical simulations of streamwise homogeneous flows. Reconstruction of the streamwise spectrum from the time spectrum using the scale-dependent convection velocity is illustrated and compared with classical strategies. The new method inherently includes not only the assessment of the validity of Taylor's hypothesis, whose trend is remarkably consistent with theoretical predictions by Lin ( Q. Appl. Maths , vol. X(4), 1953, 154–165), but also the definition of a global convection velocity accounting for any arbitrary frequency band. This global velocity is shown to coincide with a correlation-based method widely used in experiments. In addition to the mathematical least-squares definition of this velocity, new interpretations based on the flow physics and turbulent micro time scales are presented. Further, the group velocity is assessed and its relation to convection is discussed.},

A surprising result is that V is approximately the same as the local mean velocity for most of the channel, except for the near‐wall region. For y+≤15, V is virtually constant, implying that perturbations of all flow variables propagate like waves near the wall. In this region, V is 55% of the centerline velocity Uc for velocity and vorticity perturbations and 75% of Uc for pressure perturbations. This is equal to U at y+=15 for velocity and vorticity perturbations, and equal to U at y+=20 for pressure perturbations, indicating that the dynamics of the near‐wall turbulence is controlled by turbulence structures present near y+≂15–20.

abstract = {Space-time correlation is a staple method for investigating the dynamic coupling of spatial and temporal scales of motion in turbulent flows. In this article, we review the space-time correlation models in both the Eulerian and Lagrangian frames of reference, which include the random sweeping and local straining models for isotropic and homogeneous turbulence, Taylor's frozen-flow model and the elliptic approximation model for turbulent shear flows, and the linear-wave propagation model and swept-wave model for compressible turbulence. We then focus on how space-time correlations are used to develop time-accurate turbulence models for the large-eddy simulation of turbulence-generated noise and particle-laden turbulence. We briefly discuss their applications to two-point closures for Kolmogorov's universal scaling of energy spectra and to the reconstruction of space-time energy spectra from a subset of spatial and temporal signals in experimental measurements. Finally, we summarize the current understandin...},

abstract = {Experimental measurements of the frequency spectra and frequency cross‐spectra of the wall pressure fluctuations beneath a turbulent boundary layer were made in a low‐noise flow facility. The data, taken over a range of flow speeds, clearly display a dimensionless frequency ($\omega$$\delta$/u$\tau$=50) at which the spectra achieve a maximum and a low‐frequency range with an approximately $\omega$2 rolloff. The scaling laws for the low‐, mid‐, and high‐frequency regions of the spectrum are established. The cross‐spectral data, obtained over a range of streamwise separations (0.21≤$\xi$/$\delta$≤16.4), allow for the computations of the decay $\Gamma$($\xi$,$\omega$) and convection velocity Uc($\xi$,$\omega$) of the wall pressure field. These data show the existence of two distinct wave number groups: a high wave number group that scales on the similarity variable k1$\xi$=$\omega$$\xi$/Uc($\xi$,$\omega$) associated with turbulent sources in the log region of the boundary layer, in which eddies decay in proportion to their size, and a low wave number group that defines the cutoff for the large‐scal...},

The dominant forcing functions are found as solutions of a Lyapunov equation and the response functions are found as the distinct solutions of a related Lyapunov equation. Neither the forcing nor the response functions can be identified with the normal modes of the linearized dynamical operator. High variance levels are sustained in these systems under stochastic forcing, largely by transfer of energy from the mean flow to the perturbation field, despite the exponential stability of all normal modes of the system. From the perspective of modal analysis the explanation for this amplification of variance can be traced to the non‐normality of the linearized dynamical operator. The great amplification of perturbation variance found for Couett...},

In this review, we first present the original derivation and early studies and then discuss the non-modal growth of streaks, the result of the lift-up process, in transitional and turbulent shear flows. In the second part, the effects on the lift-up process of additives in the fluid and of a second phase are discussed and new results presented with emphasis on particle-laden shear flows. For all cases considered, we see the lift-up process to be a very robust process, always present as a first step in subcritical transition.},

Some of the outstanding questions, such as the extent of the logarithmic overlap layer, the universality or otherwise of the principal model parameters such as the von K{\'{a}}rm{\'{a}}n “constant,” the parametrization of roughness effects, and the scaling of mean flow and Reynolds stresses, are highlighted. Research avenues that may provide answers to these questions, notably the improvement of measuring techniques and the construction of new facilities, are identified.

We numerically explore the Newton-Raphson basins of convergence, related to the libration points (which act as attractors), in the planar circular restricted five-body problem (CR5BP). The evolution of the position and the linear stability of the equilibrium points is determined, as a function of the value of the mass parameter. The attracting regions, on several types of two dimensional planes, are revealed by using the multivariate version of the classical Newton-Raphson iterative method. We perform a systematic investigation in an attempt to understand how the mass parameter affects the geometry as well as the degree of fractality of the basins of attraction. The regions of convergence are also related with the required number of iterations and also with the corresponding probability distributions.},

abstract = {This paper presents a novel sensing methodology with an extended Kalman-based fusion algorithm for attitude estimation, using inexpensive micromachined gyroscopes, accelerometers and magnetometers. Unlike conventional methodology using quaternions and Euler angles, in the proposed fusion algorithm the state vector is defined to be a 6 × 1 vector containing sensing components of earth gravity and magnetic field in the body frame. By this way, the Kalman model can be represented by linear equations, which makes the iterative computations easy to be implemented at a faster rate using inexpensive microprocessors. The computation of the filter is further simplified by updating gravity and magnetic vectors respectively in smaller dimension. Experiments are performed to validate the effectiveness of the proposed approach. {\textcopyright} 2006 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

abstract = {Space-time correlations or Eulerian two-point two-time correlations of fluctuating velocities are analytically and numerically investigated in turbulent shear flows. An elliptic model for the space-time correlations in the inertial range is developed from the similarity assumptions on the isocorrelation contours: they share a uniform preference direction and a constant aspect ratio. The similarity assumptions are justified using the Kolmogorov similarity hypotheses and verified using the direct numerical simulation (DNS) of turbulent channel flows. The model relates the space-time correlations to the space correlations via the convection and sweeping characteristic velocities. The analytical expressions for the convection and sweeping velocities are derived from the Navier-Stokes equations for homogeneous turbulent shear flows, where the convection velocity is represented by the mean velocity and the sweeping velocity is the sum of the random sweeping velocity and the shear-induced velocity. This suggests that unlike Taylor's model where the convection velocity is dominating and Kraichnan and Tennekes' model where the random sweeping velocity is dominating, the decorrelation time scales of the space-time correlations in turbulent shear flows are determined by the convection velocity, the random sweeping velocity, and the shear-induced velocity. This model predicts a universal form of the space-time correlations with the two characteristic velocities. The DNS of turbulent channel flows supports the prediction: the correlation functions exhibit a fair good collapse, when plotted against the normalized space and time separations defined by the elliptic model. {\textcopyright} 2009 The American Physical Society.},

abstract = {In this paper, we address the problem of how to account for second-order statistics of turbulent flows using low-complexity stochastic dynamical models based on the linearized Navier–Stokes equations. The complexity is quantified by the number of degrees of freedom in the linearized evolution model that are directly influenced by stochastic excitation sources. For the case where only a subset of velocity correlations are known, we develop a framework to complete unavailable second-order statistics in a way that is consistent with linearization around turbulent mean velocity. In general, white-in-time stochastic forcing is not sufficient to explain turbulent flow statistics. We develop models for coloured-in-time forcing using a maximum entropy formulation together with a regularization that serves as a proxy for rank minimization. We show that coloured-in-time excitation of the Navier–Stokes equations can also be interpreted as a low-rank modification to the generator of the linearized dynamics. Our method provides a data-driven refinement of models that originate from first principles and captures complex dynamics of turbulent flows in a way that is tractable for analysis, optimization and control design.},

abstract = {This review of shear dispersion emphasizes that the usual one-dimensional diffusion equation, derived by Taylor [Proc. R. Soc. London Ser. A 219, 186 (1953)], is an asymptotic result that is valid only at large time. One route to earlier validity is a systematic wave-number expansion based on the center manifold theorem. This procedure captures much of the early behavior but it does discard exponentially decaying transients. However, in some cases of practical importance, such as tracer release experiments in rivers, the observation of "anomalous diffusion" (i.e., tracer variance growing nonlinearly with time) is at odds with this asymptotic reduction. Alternative approximations and models, which account for exponential transients using a description that is nonlocal in time are reviewed. A secondary theme of this review is the application of shear dispersion to mixing of passive and active scalars in rivers and estuaries. An example is shear dispersion of salt in which the shear flow is created by salinity gradients. Other examples include fixed flux convection.},

abstract = {A new class of trajectory search methods for the planar circular restricted three-body problem (CR3BP) with perturbations is presented. In the phase space of the CR3BP, there exist bundles of trajectories involving the transition from one region to another inside invariant manifolds of libration point orbits. Under the influence of perturbing forces, although these trajectory bundles can change their distributions and the locations, they still remain as orbit bundles for a considerable time in the phase space of the perturbed CR3BP. This paper presents a simple procedure of locating these orbit bundles directly in the CR3BP with perturbations. It is shown that by formulating the circular restricted problem of six bodies with the sun and the elliptical restricted problem of four bodies as perturbed CR3BP systems, the bundles of these solution orbits can be systematically and directly found on an arbitrarily chosen Poincar´ e section.},

abstract = {Abstract Lumley's model for interpreting frequency spectra of streamwise velocity in high-turbulence level flows assumes 1) that the convection velocity fluctuations and the convected finestructure are statistically independent, and 2) that the characteristic function of convection velocity fluctuations can be represented by the first two terms of its series expansion. The first assumption is consistent with numerous experimental results, and we test the second with an alternative assumption: that the convection velocity fluctuations are Gaussian. The two models are found to agree well up to moderately high fluctuation levels, thus giving support for Lmnley's model in atmospheric boundary layer applications. We generalize his model to spectra of lateral velocity and a scalar, and calculate how various large-wavenumber spectral properties are disturbed by convection velocity fluctuations. The inertial subrange spectra are found to be affected relatively little, but serious spectral distortion is found at l...},

abstract = {This paper proposes a novel quaternion-based attitude estimator with magnetic, angular rate, and gravity (MARG) sensor arrays. A new structure of a fixed-gain complementary filter is designed fusing related sensors. To avoid using iterative algorithms, the accelerometer-based attitude determination is transformed into a linear system. Stable solution to this system is obtained via control theory. With only one matrix multiplication, the solution can be computed. Using the increment of the solution, we design a complementary filter that fuses gyroscope and accelerometer together. The proposed filter is fast, since it is free of iteration. We name the proposed filter the fast complementary filter (FCF). To decrease significant effects of unknown magnetic distortion imposing on the magnetometer, a stepwise filtering architecture is designed. The magnetic output is fused with the estimated gravity from gyroscope and accelerometer using a second complementary filter when there is no significant magnetic distortion. Several experiments are carried out on real hardware to show the performance and some comparisons. Results show that the proposed FCF can reach the accuracy of Kalman filter. It successfully finds a balance between estimation accuracy and time consumption. Compared with iterative methods, the proposed FCF has much less convergence speed. Besides, it is shown that the magnetic distortion would not affect the estimated Euler angles.},

abstract = {Understanding the non-local pressure contributions and viscous effects on the small- scale statistics remains one of the central challenges in the study of homogeneous isotropic turbulence. Here we address this issue by studying the impact of the pressure Hessian as well as viscous diffusion on the statistics of the velocity gradient tensor in the framework of an exact statistical evolution equation. This evolution equation shares similarities with earlier phenomenological models for the Lagrangian velocity gradient tensor evolution, yet constitutes the starting point for a systematic study of the unclosed pressure Hessian and viscous diffusion terms. Based on the assumption of incompressible Gaussian velocity fields, closed expressions are obtained as the results of an evaluation of the characteristic functionals. The benefits and shortcomings of this Gaussian closure are discussed, and a generalization is proposed based on results from direct numerical simulations. This enhanced Gaussian closure yields, for example, insights on how the pressure Hessian prevents the finite-time singularity induced by the local self-amplification and how its interaction with viscous effects leads to the characteristic strain skewness phenomenon.},

However, these advantages are accompanied with control challenges because of two different flight regimes and drastically changing dynamics during transition flights. This paper focuses on the design of a unified controller free from cumbersome controller switchings and applicable in all attitude range for a tail-sitter with single thrust-vectored propeller. To achieve this, both thrust vectoring model and full-regime aerodynamics model are built first, after which a complete attitude dynamics model of the tail-sitter is established utilizing the quaternion attitude description to avoid the singularity problem. An adaptive controller is then derived based on a simplified model using the Lyapunov stability theory with unknown system parameters identified online by forgetting factor recursive least square (FF-RLS) method. Flight experiments are conducted to demonstrate the feasibility and effectiveness of the proposed control scheme.},

abstract = {Identifying the source of passive scalar transported in a turbulent environment from remote measurements is an ill-posed problem due to the irreversibility of diffusive processes. A significant difficulty of the source reconstruction is due to different potential source locations generating very highly correlated signals at the sensor. A variational algorithm is formulated, which utilizes high-fidelity simulations to reconstruct the spatial distribution of the source. A cost functional is defined based on the difference between the true measurements and their prediction from the simulations with the estimated source. Using forward–adjoint looping, the gradient of the cost functional with respect to the source distribution is evaluated, and the estimate of the source is updated. The adjoint-variational approach naturally accommodates measurements from multiple sensors, with essentially the same computational cost. The algorithm is evaluated for scalar dispersion in turbulent channel flow. When a single sensor is placed directly downstream of the source, the reconstruction is accurate in the cross-stream directions and is elongated in the streamwise direction. The estimated source, however, can reproduce the measurements and the scalar plume downstream of the sensor location. In the channel centre and log layer, the scalar fields are dominated by dispersion, and therefore the reconstruction is better than in the near-wall regions, where the scalar fields are dominated by diffusion. When a sensor is placed near the wall, the accuracy of the source recovery deteriorates due to diffusive effects. By using more sensors that span the plume cross-section, improvement of performance can be demonstrated despite an enlarged domain of dependence.},

abstract = {A Hamiltonian formulation is constructed for a finite ion Larmor radius fluid model describing ion temperature-gradient driven and drift Kelvin-Helmholtz modes. The Hamiltonian formulation reveals the existence of three invariants obeying detailed conservation properties, corresponding roughly to generalized potential vorticity, internal energy and ion momentum parallel to the magnetic field. These three invariants are added to the energy to form a variational principle that describes coherent structures (CSs), such as monopolar and dipolar vortices or modons. It is suggested that the invariants are responsible for the coherence and longevity of CSs and for their robustness during binary collisions.},

abstract = {In shear flows like pipe flow and plane Couette flow there is an extended range of parameters where linearly stable laminar flow coexists with a transient turbulent dynamics. When increasing the amplitude of a perturbation on top of the laminar flow, one notes a a qualitative change in its lifetime, from smoothly varying and short one on the laminar side to sensitively dependent on initial conditions and long on the turbulent side. The point of transition defines a point on the edge of chaos. Since it is defined via the lifetimes, the edge of chaos can also be used in situations when the turbulence is not persistent. It then generalises the concept of basin boundaries, which separate two coexisting attractors, to cases where the dynamics on one side shows transient chaos and almost all trajectories eventually end up on the other side. In this paper we analyse a two-dimensional map which captures many of the features identified in laboratory experiments and direct numerical simulations of hydrodynamic flows. The analysis of the map shows that different dynamical situations in the edge of chaos can be combined with different dynamical situations in the turbulent region. Consequently, the model can be used to develop and test further characterisations that are also applicable to realistic flows.},

Accumulating evidence shows that a significant nonequilibrium region exists in various turbulent flows in which the energy spectrum has Kolmogorov's −5/3 wave-number scaling over a wide wave-number range, yet C ∼ Re m I /Re n L , with m ≈ 1 ≈ n, Re I a global/inlet Reynolds number, and Re L a local turbulence Reynolds number.},

abstract = {{\textcopyright} 2018 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor  &  Francis Group The Navier–Stokes equations written in the vector potential can be recast as non-linear Schr{\"{o}}dinger equations at imaginary times, i.e. heat equations with a potential term, using the Cole–Hopf transform. On this basis, we study two kinds of Navier–Stokes flows by means of direct numerical simulations. In an experiment on vortex reconnection, it is found that the potential term takes large negative values in regions where intensive reconnection takes place, whereas the signature of the non-linear term is more broadly spread. For decaying turbulence starting from a random initial condition, such a correspondence is also observed in the early stage when the flow is dominated by vorticity layers. At later times, when the flow features several tubular vortices, this correspondence becomes weaker. Finally, a similar set of transformations is presented for the magneto–hydrodynamic equations, which reduces them to a set of heat equations with suitable potential terms, thereby obtaining new criteria for the regularity of their solutions.},

The connection between L2-gain and passivity via scattering is detailed. The passivity concepts are enriched by a generalised Hamiltonian formalism, emphasizing the close relations with modeling and control by interconnection. Feedback equivalence to a passive system and resulting stabilization strategies are discussed. The potential of L2-gain techniques in nonlinear control is demonstrated, including a compact treatment of the nonlinear Hx optimal control problem.

Furthermore, the framework is extended to cover Euler's equations for an ideal fluid on a domain with permeable boundary.

abstract = {Orientation estimation using low cost sensors is an important task for Micro Aerial Vehicles (MAVs) in order to obtain a good feedback for the attitude controller. The challenges come from the low accuracy and noisy data of the MicroElectroMechanical System (MEMS) technology, which is the basis of modern, miniaturized inertial sensors. In this article, we describe a novel approach to obtain an estimation of the orientation in quaternion form from the observations of gravity and magnetic field. Our approach provides a quaternion estimation as the algebraic solution of a system from inertial/magnetic observations. We separate the problems of finding the " tilt " quaternion and the heading quaternion in two sub-parts of our system. This procedure is the key for avoiding the impact of the magnetic disturbances on the roll and pitch components of the orientation when the sensor is surrounded by unwanted magnetic flux. We demonstrate the validity of our method first analytically and then empirically using simulated data. We propose a novel complementary filter for MAVs that fuses together gyroscope data with accelerometer and magnetic field readings. The correction part of the filter is based on the method described above and works for both IMU (Inertial Measurement Unit) and MARG (Magnetic, Angular Rate, and Gravity) sensors. We evaluate the effectiveness of the filter and show that it significantly outperforms other common methods, using publicly available datasets with ground-truth data recorded during a real flight experiment of a micro quadrotor helicopter.},

abstract = {We develop a method to estimate space-time flow statistics from a limited set of known data. While previous work has focused on modeling spatial or temporal statistics independently, space-time statistics carry fundamental information about the physics and coherent motions of the flow and provide a starting point for low-order modeling and flow control efforts. The method is derived using a statistical interpretation of resolvent analysis. The central idea of our approach is to use known data to infer the statistics of the nonlinear terms that constitute a forcing on the linearized Navier-Stokes equations, which in turn imply values for the remaining unknown flow statistics through application of the resolvent operator. Rather than making an a priori rank-1 assumption, our method allows the known input data to select the most relevant portions of the resolvent operator for describing the data, making it well-suited for high-rank turbulent flows. We demonstrate the predictive capabilities of the method using two examples: the Ginzburg-Landau equation, which serves as a convenient model for a convectively unstable flow, and a turbulent channel flow at low Reynolds number.},

Further from the wall, large-scale\nstructures that scale with outer variables organize with spacing\nlambda(z)/delta = 0.75-0.9, and these motions dominate the spanwise\ndistribution of streamwise energy throughout the logarithmic region.\nThe large spanwise modes are associated with the large streamwise\nmodes on average, as the median energetic spanwise mode increases\nroughly linearly with increasing streamwise mode up to approximately\nlambda(z.med)/delta approximate to 0.8, and then remains roughly\nconstant for larger streamwise modes.

@article{Tol2017,
abstract = { A new framework is presented for estimation and control of instabilities in wall-bounded shear flows described by the linearised Navier–Stokes equations. The control design considers the use of localised actuators/sensors to account for convective instabilities in an ${\mathcal{H}}_{2}$ optimal control framework. External sources of disturbances are assumed to enter the control domain through the inflow. A new inflow disturbance model is proposed for external excitation of the perturbation modes that contribute to transition. This model allows efficient estimation of the flow perturbations within the localised control region of a conceptually unbounded domain. The state-space discretisation of the infinite-dimensional system is explicitly obtained, which allows application of linear control theoretic tools. A reduced-order model is subsequently derived using exact balanced truncation that captures the input/output behaviour and the dominant perturbation dynamics. This model is used to design an ${\mathcal{H}}_{2}$ optimal controller to suppress the instability growth. The two-dimensional non-periodic channel flow is considered as an application case. Disturbances are generated upstream of the control domain and the resulting flow perturbations are estimated/controlled using point wall shear measurements and localised unsteady blowing and suction at the wall. The controller is able to cancel the perturbations and is robust to both unmodelled disturbances and sensor inaccuracies. For single-frequency and multiple-frequency disturbances with low sensor noise a nearly full cancellation is achieved. For stochastic forced disturbances and high sensor noise an energy reduction in perturbation wall shear stress of 96 % is shown. },

abstract = {Of the three collinear libration points of the Sun-Earth Circular Restricted Three-Body Problem (CR3BP), L3 is that located opposite to the Earth with respect to the Sun and approximately at the same heliocentric distance. Whereas several space missions have been launched to the other two collinear equilibrium points, i. e., L1 and L2, taking advantage of their dynamical and geometrical characteristics, the region around L3 is so far unexploited. This is essentially due to the severe communication limitations caused by the distant and permanent opposition to the Earth, and by the gravitational perturbations mainly induced by Jupiter and the close passages of Venus, whose effects are more important than those due to the Earth. However, the adoption of a suitable periodic orbit around L3 to ensure the necessary communication links with the Earth, or the connection with one or more relay satellites located at L4 or L5, and the simultaneous design of an appropriate station keeping-strategy, would make it possible to perform valuable fundamental physics and astrophysics investigations from this location. Such an opportunity leads to the need of studying the ways to transfer a spacecraft (s/c) from the Earth's vicinity to L3. In this contribution, we investigate several trajectory design methods to accomplish such a transfer, i. e., various types of two-burn impulsive trajectories in a Sun-s/c two-body model, a patched conics strategy exploiting the gravity assist of the nearby planets, an approach based on traveling on invariant manifolds of periodic orbits in the Sun-Earth CR3BP, and finally a low-thrust transfer. We examine advantages and drawbacks, and we estimate the propellant budget and time of flight requirements of each. {\textcopyright} 2010 Springer Science+Business Media B.V.},

abstract = {This paper presents a sum-of-squares (SOS) approach to polynomial fuzzy observer designs for three classes of polynomial fuzzy systems. The proposed SOS-based framework provides a number of innovations and improvements over the existing linear matrix inequality (LMI)-based approaches to Takagi-Sugeno (T-S) fuzzy controller and observer designs. First, we briefly summarize previous results with respect to a polynomial fuzzy system that is a more general representation of the well-known T-S fuzzy system. Next, we propose polynomial fuzzy observers to estimate states in three classes of polynomial fuzzy systems and derive SOS conditions to design polynomial fuzzy controllers and observers. A remarkable feature of the SOS design conditions for the first two classes (Classes I and II) is that they realize the so-called separation principle, i.e., the polynomial fuzzy controller and observer for each class can be separately designed without lack of guaranteeing the stability of the overall control system in addition to converging state-estimation error (via the observer) to zero. Although, for the last class (Class III), the separation principle does not hold, we propose an algorithm to design polynomial fuzzy controller and observer satisfying the stability of the overall control system in addition to converging state-estimation error (via the observer) to zero. All the design conditions in the proposed approach can be represented in terms of SOS and are symbolically and numerically solved via the recently developed SOSTOOLS and a semidefinite-program solver, respectively. To illustrate the validity and applicability of the proposed approach, three design examples are provided. The examples demonstrate the advantages of the SOS-based approaches for the existing LMI approaches to T-S fuzzy observer designs.},

abstract = {The present paper reports on our effort to characterize vortical interactions in complex fluid flows through the use of network analysis. In particular, we examine the vortex interactions in two-dimensional decaying isotropic turbulence and find that the vortical-interaction network can be characterized by a weighted scale-free network. It is found that the turbulent flow network retains its scale-free behaviour until the characteristic value of circulation reaches a critical value. Furthermore, we show that the two-dimensional turbulence network is resilient against random perturbations, but can be greatly influenced when forcing is focused towards the vortical structures, which are categorized as network hubs. These findings can serve as a network-analytic foundation to examine complex geophysical and thin-film flows and take advantage of the rapidly growing field of network theory, which complements ongoing turbulence research based on vortex dynamics, hydrodynamic stability, and statistics. While additional work is essential to extend the mathematical tools from network analysis to extract deeper physical insights of turbulence, an understanding of turbulence based on the interaction-based network-theoretic framework presents a promising alternative in turbulence modelling and control efforts.},

abstract = {Simple aerodynamic configurations under even modest conditions can exhibit complex flows with a wide range of temporal and spatial features. It has become common practice in the analysis of these flows to look for and extract physically important features, or modes, as a first step in the analysis. This step typically starts with a modal decomposition of an experimental or numerical dataset of the flow field, or of an operator relevant to the system. We describe herein some of the dominant techniques for accomplishing these modal decompositions and analyses that have seen a surge of activity in recent decades. For a non-expert, keeping track of recent developments can be daunting, and the intent of this document is to provide an introduction to modal analysis that is accessible to the larger fluid dynamics community. In particular, we present a brief overview of several of the well-established techniques and clearly lay the framework of these methods using familiar linear algebra. The modal analysis techniques covered in this paper include the proper orthogonal decomposition (POD), balanced proper orthogonal decomposition (Balanced POD), dynamic mode decomposition (DMD), Koopman analysis, global linear stability analysis, and resolvent analysis.},

It is apparent that the approach to an asymptotically high–Reynolds number state is slow, but at a sufficiently high Reynolds number the log law remains a fundamental part of the mean flow description. With regard to the coherent motions, very-large-scale motions or superstructures exist at all Reynolds numbers, but they become increasingly important with Reynolds number in terms of their energy content and their interaction with the smaller scales near the wall. There is accumulating evidence that certain features are flow specific, such as the constants in the log law and the behavior of the very large scales and their interaction with the large scales (consisting of vortex packets). Moreover, the refined attached-eddy hypothesis continues to provide an important theoretical framework for the structure of wall-bounded turbulent flows.},

abstract = {We model turbulent plane Couette flow in the minimal flow unit (MFU) – a domain whose spanwise and streamwise extent is just sufficient to maintain turbulence – by expanding the velocity field as a sum of optimal modes calculated via proper orthogonal decomposition from numerical data. Ordinary differential equations are obtained by Galerkin projection of the Navier–Stokes equations onto these modes. We first consider a 6-mode (11-dimensional) model and study the effects of including losses to neglected modes. Ignoring these, the model reproduces turbulent statistics acceptably, but fails to reproduce dynamics; including them, we find a stable periodic orbit that captures the regeneration cycle dynamics and agrees well with direct numerical simulations. However, restriction to as few as six modes artificially constrains the relative magnitudes of streamwise vortices and streaks and so cannot reproduce stability of the laminar state or properly account for bifurcations to turbulence as Reynolds number increases. To address this issue, we develop a second class of models based on ‘uncoupled' eigenfunctions that allow independence among streamwise and cross-stream velocity components. A 9-mode (31-dimensional) model produces bifurcation diagrams for steady and periodic states in qualitative agreement with numerical Navier–Stokes solutions, while preserving the regeneration cycle dynamics. Together, the models provide empirical evidence that the ‘backbone' for MFU turbulence is a periodic orbit, and support the roll–streak–breakdown–roll reformation picture of shear-driven turbulence.},

It is the accurate reproduction of the skewness that permits a delay-diffusion equation to become applicable at an earlier stage than the more conventional diffusion-equation models for longitudinal dispersion, and before there has been an undue loss of contaminant through the boundary.

abstract = {1 This review article is concerned with the design of linear reduced-order models and con-trol laws for closed-loop control of instabilities in transitional flows. For oscillator flows, such as open-cavity flows, we suggest the use of optimal control techniques with Galerkin models based on unstable global modes and balanced modes. Particular attention has to be paid to stability–robustness properties of the control law. Specifically, we show that large delays and strong amplification between the control input and the estimation sensor may be detrimental both to performance and robustness. For amplifier flows, such as backward-facing step flow, the requirement to account for the upstream disturbance envi-ronment rules out Galerkin models. In this case, an upstream sensor is introduced to detect incoming perturbations, and identification methods are used to fit a model struc-ture to available input–output data. Control laws, obtained by direct inversion of the input–output relations, are found to be robust when applied to the large-scale numerical simulation. All the concepts are presented in a step-by-step manner, and numerical codes are provided for the interested reader.},

abstract = {One-point statistics are presented for new direct simulations of the zero-pressure-gradient turbulent boundary layer in the range Re$\theta$ = 2780–6680, matching channels and pipes at $\delta$+ ≈ 1000–2000. For tripped boundary layers, it is found that the eddy-turnover length is a better criterion than the Reynolds number for the recovery of the largest flow scales after an artificial inflow. Beyond that limit, the integral parameters, mean velocities, Reynolds stresses, and pressure fluctuations of the new simulations agree very well with the available numerical and experimental data, but show clear differences with internal flows when expressed in wall units at the same wall distance and Reynolds number. Those differences are largest in the outer layer, independent of the Reynolds number, and apply to the three velocity components. The logarithmic increase with the Reynolds number of the maximum of the streamwise velocity and pressure fluctuations is confirmed to apply to experimental and numerical internal and external flows. The new simulations also extend to a wider range of Reynolds numbers, and to more than a decade in wall distance, the evidence for logarithmic intensity profiles of the spanwise velocity and of the pressure intensities. Streamwise velocity fluctuations appear to require higher Reynolds numbers to develop a clear logarithmic profile, but it is argued that the comparison of the available near-wall data with fluctuation profiles experimentally obtained by other groups at higher Reynolds numbers can only be explained by assuming the existence of a mesolayer for the fluctuations. The statistics of the new simulation are available in our website. {\textcopyright} 2013 AIP Publishing LLC},

Three-dimensional spatial correlations are investigated in very long domains to educe the average structure of the velocity and pressure fluctuations. The streamwise velocity component is found to be coherent over longer distances in channels than in boundary layers, especially in the direction of the flow. For weakly correlated structures, the maximum streamwise length is O ( 7 $\delta$ ) for boundary layers and O ( 18 $\delta$ ) for channels, attained at the logarithmic and outer regions, respectively. The corresponding lengths for the spanwise and wall-normal velocities and for the pressure are shorter, O ( $\delta$ -2$\delta$). The correlations are shown to be inclined to the wall at angles that depend on the distance from the wall, on the variable being considered, and on the correlation level used to define them. All these features change little between the two types of flows. Most the above features are also approximately independent of the Reynolds number, except for the pressure, and for the streamwise velocity structures in the channel. Further insight into the flow is provided by correlations conditioned on the intensity of the perturbations at the reference point, or on their sign. The statistics of the new simulation are available in our website.},

abstract = {Modeling of fluid dynamics and the associated heat transfer induced by plasma between two parallel electrodes is investigated. In particular, we consider a capacitvely coupled radio frequency discharge plasma generator, where the plasma is generated on the surface of a dielectric circuit board with electrode strips on the top and bottom. The electrodes have a thickness of 100 ? m, which is comparable to the height of the boundary layer. The regime considered is that the electron component is in the non-equilibrium state, and the plasma is nonthermal. Overall, due to the ion and large fluid particle interaction, the pressure is higher in the downstream of the electrode, causing the velocity structure to resemble that of a wall jet. Parameters related to the electrode operation, including the voltage, frequency, and free stream speed are varied to investigate the characteristics of the plasma-induced flow. Consistent with the experimental observation, the model shows a clear dependence of the induced jet velocity on the applied voltage and frequency. The heat flux exhibited a similar dependence on the strength of the plasma. The present plasma-induced flow concept can be useful for thermal management and active flow control.},

@article{Sharma2013a,
abstract = {A new theory of coherent structure in wall turbulence is presented. The theory is the first to predict packets of hairpin vortices and other structure in turbulence, and their dynamics, based on an analysis of the Navier-Stokes equations, under an assumption of a turbulent mean profile. The assumption of the turbulent mean acts as a restriction on the class of possible structures. It is shown that the coherent structure is a manifestation of essentially low-dimensional flow dynamics, arising from a critical layer mechanism. Using the decomposition presented in McKeon & Sharma (J. Fluid Mech, 658, 2010), complex coherent structure is recreated from minimal superpositions of response modes predicted by the analysis, which take the form of radially-varying travelling waves. By way of example, simple combinations of these modes are offered that predicts hairpins and modulated hairpin packets. The phase interaction also predicts important skewness and correlation results known in the literature. It is also shown that the very large scale motions act to organise hairpin-like structures such that they co-locate with areas of low streamwise momentum, by a mechanism of locally varying the shear profile. The relationship between Taylor's hypothesis and coherence is discussed and both are shown to be the consequence of the localisation of the response modes around the critical layer. A pleasing link is made to the classical laminar inviscid theory, whereby the essential mechanism underlying the hairpin vortex is captured by two obliquely interacting Kelvin-Stuart (cat's eye) vortices. Evidence for the theory is presented based on comparison to observations of structure reported in the experimental, transitional flow and turbulent flow numerical simulation literature.},

Using the lifetime as an indicator and methods developed in (Skufca et al, Phys. Rev.

abstract = {Linear stability of incompressible flow in a circular pipe is considered. Use is made of a vector function formulation involving the radial velocity and radial vorticity only. Asymptotic as well as transient stability are investigated using eigenvalues and E-pseudoeigenvalues, respectively. Energy stability is probed by establishing a link to the numerical range of the linear stability operator. Substantial transient growth followed by exponential decay has been found and parameter studies revealed that the maximum amplification of initial energy density is experienced by disturbances with no streamwise dependence and azimuthal wavenumber n = 1. It has also been found that the maximum in energy scales with the Reynolds number squared, as for other shear flows. The flow field of the optimal disturbance, exploiting the transient growth mechanism maximally, has been determined and followed in time. Optimal disturbances are in general characterized by a strong shear layer in the centre of the pipe and their overall structure has been found not to change significantly as time evolves. The presented linear transient growth mechanism which has its origin in the non-normality of the linearized Navier-Stokes operator, may provide a viable process for triggering finite-amplitude effects.},

The dynamics of coherent structures near the wall of a turbulent boundary layer is investigated with the aim of a low-dimensional representation of its essential features. Based on a triple decomposition into mean, coherent and incoherent motion and a dynamic mode decomposition to recover statistical information about the incoherent part of the flow field, a driven linear system coupling first- and second-order moments of the coherent structures is derived and analysed. The transfer function for this system, evaluated for a wall-parallel plane, confirms a strong bias towards streamwise elongated structures, and is proposed as an 'impedance' boundary condition which replaces the bulk of the transport between the coherent velocity field and the coherent Reynolds stresses, thus acting as a wall model for large-eddy simulations (LES). It is interesting to note that the boundary condition is non-local in space and time. The extracted model is capable of reproducing the principal Reynolds stress components for the pretransitional, transitional and fully turbulent boundary layer.},

These systems arise for instance as Galerkin systems of incompressible flows. A criterion is presented to ensure long-term boundedness of the system dynamics. If the criterion is violated, a globally stable attractor cannot exist for an effective nonlinearity. Thus, the criterion can be considered a minimum requirement for control-oriented Galerkin models of viscous fluid flows. The criterion is exemplified, for example, for Galerkin systems of two-dimensional cylinder wake flow models in the transient and the post-transient regime, for the Lorenz system and for wall-bounded shear flows. There are numerous potential applications of the criterion, for instance, system reduction and control of strongly nonlinear dynamical systems.},

abstract = {Starting from the four-body problem a generalization of both the restricted three-body problem and the Hill three-body problem is derived. The model is time periodic and contains two parameters: the mass ratio v of the restricted three-body problem and the period parameter m of the Hill Variation orbit. In the proper coordinate frames the restricted three-body problem is recovered as m → 0 and the classical Hill three-body problem is recovered as v → 0. This model also predicts motions described by earlier researchers using specific models of the Earth-Moon-Sun system. An application of the current model to the motion of a spacecraft in the Sun perturbed Earth-Moon system is made using Hill's Variation orbit for the motion of the Earth-Moon system. The model is general enough to apply to the motion of an infinitesimal mass under the influence of any two primaries which orbit a larger mass. Using the model, numerical investigations of the structure of motions around the geometric position of the triangular Lagrange points are performed. Values of the parameter v range in the neighborhood of the Earth-Moon value as the parameter m increases from 0 to 0.195, at which point the Hill Variation orbit becomes unstable. Two families of planar periodic orbits are studied in detail as the parameters m and v vary. These families contain stable and unstable members in the plane and all have the out-of-plane stability. The stable and unstable manifolds of the unstable periodic orbits are computed and found to be trapped in a geometric area of phase space over long periods of time for ranges of the parameter values including the Earth-Moon-Sun system. This model is derived from the general four-body problem by rigorous application of the Hill and restricted approximations. The validity of the Hill approximation is discussed in light of the actual geometry of the Earth-Moon-Sun system.},

abstract = { Three methods are evaluated to estimate the streamwise velocity fluctuations of a zero-pressure-gradient turbulent boundary layer of momentum-thickness-based Reynolds number up to    $Re_{\unicode[STIX]{x1D703}}\simeq 8200$   , using as input velocity fluctuations at different wall-normal positions. A system identification approach is considered where large-eddy simulation data are used to build single and multiple-input linear and nonlinear transfer functions. Such transfer functions are then treated as convolution kernels and may be used as models for the prediction of the fluctuations. Good agreement between predicted and reference data is observed when the streamwise velocity in the near-wall region is estimated from fluctuations in the outer region. Both the unsteady behaviour of the fluctuations and the spectral content of the data are properly predicted. It is shown that approximately 45 % of the energy in the near-wall peak is linearly correlated with the outer-layer structures, for the reference case    $Re_{\unicode[STIX]{x1D703}}=4430$   . These identified transfer functions allow insight into the causality between the different wall-normal locations in a turbulent boundary layer along with an estimation of the tilting angle of the large-scale structures. Differences in accuracy of the methods (single- and multiple-input linear and nonlinear) are assessed by evaluating the coherence of the structures between wall-normally separated positions. It is shown that the large-scale fluctuations are coherent between the outer and inner layers, by means of an interactions which strengthens with increasing Reynolds number, whereas the finer-scale fluctuations are only coherent within the near-wall region. This enables the possibility of considering the wall-shear stress as an input measurement, which would more easily allow the implementation of these methods in experimental applications. A parametric study was also performed by evaluating the effect of the Reynolds number, wall-normal positions and input quantities considered in the model. Since the methods vary in terms of their complexity for implementation, computational expense and accuracy, the technique of choice will depend on the application under consideration. We also assessed the possibility of designing and testing the models at different Reynolds numbers, where it is shown that the prediction of the near-wall peak from wall-shear-stress measurements is practically unaffected even for a one order of magnitude change in the corresponding Reynolds number of the design and test, indicating that the interaction between the near-wall peak fluctuations and the wall is approximately Reynolds-number independent. Furthermore, given the performance of such methods in the prediction of flow features in turbulent boundary layers, they have a good potential for implementation in experiments and realistic flow control applications, where the prediction of the near-wall peak led to correlations above 0.80 when wall-shear stress was used in a multiple-input or nonlinear scheme. Errors of the order of 20 % were also observed in the determination of the near-wall spectral peak, depending on the employed method. },

Group sparsity is used to ensure parsimonious representations of observed dynamics in the form of a parametric PDE, while also allowing the coefficients to have arbitrary time series, or spatial dependence. This work builds on previous methods for the identification of constant coefficient PDEs, expanding the field to include a new class of equations which until now have eluded machine learning based identification methods. We show that group sequentially thresholded ridge regression outperforms group LASSO in identifying the fewest terms in the PDE along with their parametric dependency.

abstract = {We present a technique for describing the global behaviour of complex nonlinear flows by decomposing the flow into modes determined from spectral analysis of the Koopman operator, an infinite-dimensional linear operator associated with the full nonlinear system. These modes, referred to as Koopman modes, are associated with a particular observable, and may be determined directly from data (either numerical or experimental) using a variant of a standard Arnoldi method. They have an associated temporal frequency and growth rate and may be viewed as a nonlinear generalization of global eigenmodes of a linearized system. They provide an alternative to proper orthogonal decomposition, and in the case of periodic data the Koopman modes reduce to a discrete temporal Fourier transform. The Arnoldi method used for computations is identical to the dynamic mode decomposition recently proposed by Schmid & Sesterhenn (Sixty-First Annual Meeting of the APS Division of Fluid Dynamics, 2008), so dynamic mode decomposition can be thought of as an algorithm for finding Koopman modes. We illustrate the method on an example of a jet in crossflow, and show that the method captures the dominant frequencies and elucidates the associated spatial structures. {\textcopyright} 2009 Cambridge University Press.},

In this paper, we investigate a special class of multiple gravity assists which can occur outside of the perturbing body's sphere of influence (the Hill sphere) and which is dynamically connected to orbits that get captured by the perturber and orbits which escape to infinity. We proceed by deriving a family of symplectic twist maps to approximate a particle's motion in the planar circular restricted three-body problem. The maps capture well the dynamics of the full equations of motion; the phase space contains a connected chaotic zone where intersections between unstable resonant orbit manifolds provide the template for lanes of fast migration between orbits of different semimajor axes. Within the chaotic zone, the concept of a set of reachable orbits is useful. This set can be considered bounded by, on one end, orbits leading to ballistic capture around the perturber, and on the other end, the orbits escaping to infinity or a bounding surface at finite distance.},

In particular, for systems described by Port-Controlled Hamiltonian (PCH) models, the "control by interconnection" method provides a simple and elegant procedure for stabilization of nonlinear systems with finite dissipation. In this paper we explore the possibility of extending this technique to the case where the plant contains a distributed parameter subsystem, in the form of a transmission line between the plant and the controller.

abstract = {This paper considers the problem of obtaining good attitude estimates from measurements obtained from typical low cost inertial measurement units. The outputs of such systems are characterized by high noise levels and time varying additive biases. We formulate the filtering problem as deterministic observer kinematics posed directly on the special orthogonal group SO (3) driven by reconstructed attitude and angular velocity measurements. Lyapunov analysis results for the proposed observers are derived that ensure almost global stability of the observer error. The approach taken leads to an observer that we term the direct complementary filter. By exploiting the geometry of the special orthogonal group a related observer, termed the passive complementary filter, is derived that decouples the gyro measurements from the reconstructed attitude in the observer inputs. Both the direct and passive filters can be extended to estimate gyro bias online. The passive filter is further developed to provide a formulation in terms of the measurement error that avoids any algebraic reconstruction of the attitude. This leads to an observer on SO(3), termed the explicit complementary filter, that requires only accelerometer and gyro outputs; is suitable for implementation on embedded hardware; and provides good attitude estimates as well as estimating the gyro biases online. The performance of the observers are demonstrated with a set of experiments performed on a robotic test-bed and a radio controlled unmanned aerial vehicle.},

abstract = {Large-eddy simulations are carried out to investigate plasma-based flow
control that is used to delay transition generated by excrescence on the
leading edge of a wing. The wing airfoil section has a geometry that is
representative of modern reconnaissance air vehicles and has an
appreciable region of laminar flow at design conditions. Modification of
the leading edge, which can be caused by the accumulation of debris,
insect impacts, microscopic ice crystal formation, damage, or structural
fatigue, may result in premature transition and an increase in drag. A
dielectric barrier discharge plasma actuator, located downstream of the
excrescence, is employed to mitigate transition, decrease drag, and
increase energy efficiency. Numerical solutions are obtained to the
Navier-Stokes equations that were augmented by source terms used to
represent the body force imparted by the plasma actuator on the fluid. A
simple phenomenological model provided this force resulting from the
electric field generated by the plasma. The numerical method is based
upon a high-fidelity numerical scheme and an implicit time-marching
approach. An overset mesh system is employed to represent excrescence in
the leading-edge region. Solutions are generated for both uniform and
distributed excrescence geometries, as well as for the clean wing
configuration without leading-edge modification. Results are obtained
for two different values of the plasma field strength. Features of the
computational flowfields are elucidated, and the effectiveness of
control is quantified by comparison with baseline results without plasma
actuation. It is found that plasma control can reestablish the laminar
flow region lost to excrescence-generated transition and increase the
lift-to-drag ratio by up to 8.7%.},

abstract = {In recent work it has been shown that there can be substantial transient growth in the energy of small perturbations to plane Poiseuille and Couette flows if the Reynolds number is below the critical value predicted by linear stability analysis. This growth, which may be as large as O(lOOO), occurs in the absence of nonlinear effects and can be explained by the non-normality of the governing linear operator -that is, the non-orthogonality of the associated eigenfunctions. In this paper we study various aspects of this energy growth for two-and three-dimensional Poiseuille and Couette flows using energy methods, linear stability analysis, and a direct numerical procedure for computing the transient growth. We examine conditions for no energy growth, the dependence of the growth on the streamwise and spanwise wavenumbers, the time dependence of the growth, and the effects of degenerate eigenvalues. We show that the maximum transient growth behaves like O(R2), where R is the Reynolds number. We derive conditions for no energy growth by applying the Hille-Yosida theorem to the governing linear operator and show that these conditions yield the same results as those derived by energy methods, which can be applied to perturbations of arbitrary amplitude. These results emphasize the fact that subcritical transition can occur for Poiseuille and Couette flows because the governing linear operator is non-normal.},

First, we augment the Blasius boundary layer profile with a disturbance field resulting from the linear Parabolized Stability Equations (PSE) to obtain the modified base flow; and, second, we draw on Floquet decomposition to capture the effect of mode interactions on the spatial evolution of flow fluctuations via a linear progression. The resulting Parabolized Floquet Equations (PFE) can be conveniently advanced downstream to examine the interaction between different modes in slowly-growing spatially evolving flows. We apply our framework to two canonical settings of transition in boundary layers; the H-type transition scenario that is initiated by exponential instabilities, and streamwise elongated laminar streaks that are triggered by the lift-up mechanism. We demonstrate that the PFE capture the growth of various harmonics and provide excellent agreement with the results obtained in direct numerical simulations and in experiments.},

The consideration of such class of control systems is motivated by the use of actuators and sensors with nonlinear behavior in many engineering applications. These nonlinearities are usually associated to large deformations or the use of smart materials such as piezo actuators and memory shape alloys. Including them in the controller model results in passive dynamic controllers with nonlinear potential energy function and/or nonlinear damping forces. First it is shown that under very natural assumptions the solutions of the partial differential equation with the nonlinear dynamic boundary conditions exist globally. Secondly, when energy dissipation is present in the controller, then it globally asymptotically stabilizes the partial differential equation. Finally, it is shown that assuming some additional conditions on the interconnection and on the passivity properties of the controller (consistent with physical applications) global exponential stability of the closed-loop system is achieved.},

abstract = {We use a variational formulation incorporating the full Navier–Stokes equations to identify initial perturbations with finite kinetic energy E0 which generate the largest gain in perturbation kinetic energy at some time T later for plane Couette flow. Using the flow geometry originally used by Butler & Farrell (Phys. Fluids A, vol. 4, 1992, pp. 1637–1650) to identify the linear transient optimal perturbations for E0→0 and incorporating T as part of the optimization procedure, we show how the addition of nonlinearity smoothly changes the result as E0 increases from zero until a small but finite Ec is reached. At this point, the variational algorithm is able to identify an initial condition of completely different form which triggers turbulence – called the minimal seed for turbulence. If instead T is fixed at some asymptotically large value, as suggested by Pringle, Willis & Kerswell (J. Fluid Mech., vol. 703, 2012, pp. 415–443), a fundamentally different ‘final' optimal perturbation emerges from time intervals is always less than the equivalent maximum gain for the ‘quasi-linear optimal perturbation', i.e. the finite-amplitude manifestation of the underlying linear optimal perturbation. We also consider a wider flow geometry recently studied by Monokrousos et al. (Phys. Rev. Lett., vol. 106, 2011, 134502) and present evidence that the critical energy for transition Ec they found by using total dissipation over a time interval as the optimizing functional is recovered using energy gain at a fixed target time as the optimizing functional, with the same associated minimal seed emerging. This emphasizes that the precise form of the functional does not appear to be important for identifying Ec provided it takes heightened values for turbulent flows, as postulated by Pringle, Willis & Kerswell (J. Fluid Mech., vol. 703, 2012, pp. 415–443). All our results highlight the irrelevance of the linear energy gain optimal perturbation for predicting or describing the lowest-energy flow structure which triggers turbulence. our algorithm above some threshold initial energy Ef ∈ (0,Ec) which shows signs of localization.

In this work, we propose a conceptual framework to recover parsimonious models of a system in response to abrupt changes in the low-data limit. First, the abrupt change is detected by comparing the estimated Lyapunov time of the data with the model prediction. Next, we apply the sparse identification of nonlinear dynamics (SINDy) regression to update a previously identified model with the fewest changes, either by addition, deletion, or modification of existing model terms. We demonstrate this sparse model recovery on several examples for abrupt system change detection in periodic and chaotic dynamical systems. Our examples show that sparse updates to a previously identified model perform better with less data, have lower runtime complexity, and are less sensitive to noise than identifying an entirely new model. The proposed abrupt-SINDy architecture provides a new paradigm for the rapid and efficient recovery of a system model after abrupt changes.},

abstract = {Is it possible to find the sparsest vector (direction) in a generic subspace $\mathcal{S} \subseteq \mathbb{R}^p$ with $\mathrm{dim}(\mathcal{S})= n < p$? This problem can be considered a homogeneous variant of the sparse recovery problem, and finds connections to sparse dictionary learning, sparse PCA, and many other problems in signal processing and machine learning. In this paper, we focus on a **planted sparse model** for the subspace: the target sparse vector is embedded in an otherwise random subspace. Simple convex heuristics for this planted recovery problem provably break down when the fraction of nonzero entries in the target sparse vector substantially exceeds $O(1/\sqrt{n})$. In contrast, we exhibit a relatively simple nonconvex approach based on alternating directions, which provably succeeds even when the fraction of nonzero entries is $\Omega(1)$. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first practical algorithm to achieve linear scaling under the planted sparse model. Empirically, our proposed algorithm also succeeds in more challenging data models, e.g., sparse dictionary learning.},

Fluid Mech. 559, 205 (2006)]. Contrary to this previous analysis, we use generalized Orr-Sommerfeld and Squire operators consistent with previous investigations of mean flows with variable viscosity. The optimal perturbations are streamwise vortices evolving into streamwise streaks. In accordance with del {\'{A}}lamo and Jim{\'{e}}nez, it is found that for very elongated structures and for sufficiently large Reynolds numbers, the optimal energy growth presents a primary peak in the spanwise wavelength, scaling in outer units, and a secondary peak scaling in inner units and corresponding to $\lambda$ z + ≈100. Contrary to the previous results, however, it is found that the maximum energy growth associated with the primary peak increases with the Reynolds number. This growth, in a first approximation, scales linearly with an effective Reynolds number based on the centerline velocity, the channel half width and the maximum eddy viscosity associated. The optimal streaks associated with the primary peak have an optimal spacing of $\lambda$ z =4h and scale in outer units in the outer region and in wall units in the near wall region, where they still have up to 50% of their maximum amplitude near y + =10. {\textcopyright} 2009 American Institute of Physics.},

Koopman spectral analysis is a theoretical tool for the analysis of nonlinear dynamical systems. Moreover, Koopman is intimately connected to Dynamic Mode Decomposition (DMD), a method that discovers spatial-temporal coherent modes from data, connects local-linear analysis to nonlinear operator theory, and importantly creates an equation-free architecture allowing investigation of complex systems. In actuated systems, standard Koopman analysis and DMD are incapable of producing input-output models; moreover, the dynamics and the modes will be corrupted by external forcing. Our new theoretical developments extend Koopman operator theory to allow for systems with nonlinear input-output characteristics. We show how this generalization is rigorously connected and generalizes a recent development called Dynamic Mode Decomposition with control (DMDc). We demonstrate this new theory on nonlinear dynamical systems, including a standard Susceptible-Infectious-Recovered model with relevance to the analysis of infectious disease data with mass vaccination (actuation).},

abstract = {It has been almost ten years since the original release of SOSTOOLS. During this time much has changed, the number of applications that sum of squares programming has found is enormous and so is the the size and complexity of the resulting optimization problems. Moreover, the software which SOSTOOLS relies on, i.e. the SDP solvers and symbolic engines have also been evolving, the latter of these being the primary primary cause for the latest release. Previous versions of SOSTOOLS relied upon the MATLAB Symbolic Math Toolbox. When SOSTOOLS was first released, the Symbolic Math Toolbox that MATLAB used was the MAPLE engine which performed all symbolic manipulations. Recently however, MATLAB has switched from the MAPLE engine to a MuPAD engine, which has a significantly different syntax. In addition to this, there has been a surge of activity in the field of numerical optimization methods and there are now numerous Semidefinite Program (SDP) solvers available. This latest version of SOSTOOLS now includes interfaces to three new solvers, CSDP [2], SDPNAL [29] and SDPA [28] in addition to maintaining support for SeDuMi [23] and SDPT3 [25]. The highlights of the latest SOSTOOLS release are listed below: • Compatibility with MuPAD, MATLAB's symbolic engine. • Interface to additional SDP solvers. • Direct specification of polynomial matrix inequalities. • Simultaneous multiple decision variable declaration. • Sum of Squares matrix decomposition. • Interface to the new multivariate polynomial toolbox. • Additional illustrative examples. 5},

The study has as its basis the Kovasznay–Corrsin conjecture modified to account for inhomogeneities. Details of the modifications were dictated by comparison with direct numerical simulations of turbulent channel flow. For example, analysis of the simulations shows that the space–time correlations at optimal delay depict, when appropriately normalized, a form independent of turbulence component. It is also evident that the half width of the correlation grows, in the outer region of the layer, like Vn+1, while the Lagrangian time scale grows like Vn, where 2<n<3 and V is the mean convection velocity. The resulting generic form for the space–time correlation captures these effects well and brings to light a Reynolds number effect that is most evident in the tail of the correlations at nonoptimal delay.},

Experimental results show that the sensor data acquisition and filtering consumes about 6.2 ms, and the algorithm consumes about 0.96 ms with the step size $\beta$=0.8 in the 72 MHz clock frequency and soft IIC (Inter-integrated circuit). The update frequency of attitude data up to 100 Hz can meet real-time requirements. Statistics shows that the static mean absolute errors of pitch and roll are below 1.5° and the mean absolute errors of yaw are below 2.9°. The mean absolute error of pitch, roll and yaw will be increased by 1°$\sim$2° under the condition of micro-vibration of low frequency. It is indicated that the attitude estimation fusion algorithm and sensors calibration method are practical and effective which could provide accurate attitude data for precision flight control and variable operations implementation of agricultural small UAV.},

Previous work has imposed significant restrictions on the structure of the candidate Control Lyapunov Functions in order to develop appropriate LMI conditions for the design. This paper addresses this issue and provides two new results. The first result is a step towards controller synthesis using the \complete quadratic" Lyapunov functional. Specifically, given such a \complete quadratic" functional, defined by polynomials, we give an algorithm for constructing the inverse of the linear operator which defines that functional. Following this, we derive semidefinite programming conditions, expressed as a Sum-of-Squares program, for state feedback synthesis of these systems using a restricted structure of the Lyapunov functional.

This paper unifies and significantly extends many previous results which have appeared in conference and journal format. The unifying principle is that any linear parametrization of operators in Hilbert space can be used to construct an LMI parametrization of positive operators via squared representations. For linear systems, we get positive linear operators and hence quadratic Lyapunov functions. For nonlinear systems, we get nonlinear operators and hence non-quadratic Lyapunov functions. Special cases of these results include positive operators defined by multipliers and kernels which are: polynomial; piecewise-polynomial; or semi-separable and apply to systems with delay; multiple spatial domains; or mixed boundary conditions. We also introduce a set of efficient software tools for creating these functionals. Finally, we illustrate the approach with numerical examples.},

abstract = {In this dissertation, we investigate how convex optimization can be used to analyze different classes of nonlinear systems at various scales algorithmically. The methodology is based on the construction of appropriate Lyapunov-type certificates using sum of squares techniques. After a brief introduction on the mathematical tools that we will be using, we turn our attention to robust stability and performance analysis of systems described by Ordinary Differential Equations. A general framework for constrained systems analysis is developed, under which stability of systems with polynomial, non-polynomial vector fields and switching systems, as well as estimating the region of attraction and the L2 gain can be treated in a unified manner. Examples from biology and aerospace illustrate our methodology. We then consider systems described by Functional Differential Equations (FDEs), i.e., time-delay systems. Their main characteristic is that they are infinite dimensional, which complicates their analysis. We first show how the complete Lyapunov- Krasovskii functional can be constructed algorithmically for linear time-delay systems. Then, we concentrate on delay-independent and delay-dependent stability analysis of nonlinear FDEs using sum of squares techniques. An example from ecology is given. The scalable stability analysis of congestion control algorithms for the Internet is investigated next. The models we use result in an arbitrary interconnection of FDE subsystems, for which we require that stability holds for arbitrary delays, network topologies and link capacities. Through a constructive proof, we develop a Lyapunov functional for FAST – a recently developed network congestion control scheme – so that the Lyapunov stability properties scale with the system size. We also show how other network congestion control schemes can be analyzed in the same way. Finally, we concentrate on systems described by Partial Differential Equations. We show that axially constant perturbations of the Navier-Stokes equations for Hagen- Poiseuille flow are globally stable, even though the background noise is amplified as R3 where R is the Reynolds number, giving a ‘robust yet fragile' interpretation. We also propose a sum of squares methodology for the analysis of systems described by parabolic PDEs. We conclude this work with an account for future research.},

While feedback control is normally used to compensate for these imperfections, we show that this is insufficient for suppressing errors without interfering with device performance. The only alternatives are costly and time consuming post processing or the implementation of a dual stage control architecture comprised of a feedforward and feedback control which compensates for errors without interfering with the performance of the device. In this paper, we describe the design and implementation of such a control architecture for structural error suppression in MEMS vibratory gyroscopes. The feedforward portion of the control is used to "trim" large imperfections, while the feedback portion compensates for the remaining non-idealities and perturbations. The architecture includes self-diagnostic capabilities for in situ identification of structural imperfections used to set the feedforward control forces. The realization of this dual stage control architecture is demonstrated in a device using nonlinear electrostatic parallel plate actuators. We demonstrate successful compensation for a device with 10% error in ideal stiffness subjected to a further 1% perturbation during normal operation.},

abstract = {The emergence of Dynamic Mode Decomposition (DMD) as a practical way to attempt a Koopman mode decomposition of a nonlinear PDE presents exciting prospects for identifying invariant sets and slowly decaying transient structures buried in the PDE dynamics. However, there are many subtleties in connecting DMD to Koopman analysis and it remains unclear how realistic Koopman analysis is for complex systems such as the Navier-Stokes equations. With this as motivation, we present here a full Koopman decomposition for the velocity field in Burgers equation by deriving explicit expressions for the Koopman modes and eigenfunctions - the first time this has been done for a nonlinear PDE. The decomposition highlights the fact that different observables can require different subsets of Koopman eigenfunctions to express them and presents a nice example where: (i) the Koopman modes are linearly dependent and so cannot be fit a posteriori to snapshots of the flow without knowledge of the Koopman eigenfunctions; and (ii) the Koopman eigenvalues are highly degenerate which means that computed Koopman modes become initial-condition dependent. As way of illustration, we discuss the form of the Koopman expansion with various initial conditions and assess the capability of DMD to extract the decaying nonlinear coherent structures in run-down simulations.},

abstract = {A Koopman decomposition is a powerful method of analysis for fluid flows leading to an apparently linear description of nonlinear dynamics in which the flow is expressed as a superposition of fixed spatial structures with exponential time dependence. Attempting a Koopman decomposition is simple in practice due to a connection with Dynamic Mode Decomposition (DMD). However, there are non-trivial requirements for the Koopman decomposition and DMD to overlap which mean it is often difficult to establish whether the latter is truly approximating the former. Here, we focus on nonlinear systems containing multiple simple invariant solutions where it is unclear how to construct a consistent Koopman decomposition, or how DMD might be applied to locate these solutions. First, we derive a Koopman decomposition for a heteroclinic connection in a Stuart-Landau equation revealing two possible expansions. The expansions are centred about the two fixed points of the equation and extend beyond their linear subspaces before breaking down at a crossover point in state space. Well-designed DMD can extract the two expansions provided that the time window does not contain this crossover point. We then apply DMD to the Navier-Stokes equations near to a heteroclinic connection in low-Reynolds number ($Re=O(100)$) plane Couette flow where there are multiple simple invariant solutions beyond the constant shear basic state. This reveals as many different Koopman decompositions as simple invariant solutions present and again indicates the existence of crossover points between the expansions in state space. Again, DMD can extract these expansions only if it does not include a crossover point.},

abstract = {Passivity-based control (PBC) is a well-established technique that has shown to be very powerful to design robust controllers for physical systems described by Euler-Lagrange (EL) equations of motion. For regulation problems of mechanical systems, which can be stabilized "shaping" only the potential energy, PBC preserves the EL structure and furthermore assigns a closed-loop energy function equal to the difference between the energy of the system and the energy supplied by the controller. Thus, we say that stabilization is achieved via energy balancing. Unfortunately, these nice properties of EL-PBC are lost when used in other applications which require shaping of the total energy, for instance, in electrical or electromechanical systems, or even some underactuated mechanical devices. Our main objective in this paper is to develop a new PBC theory which extends to a broader class of systems the aforementioned energy-balancing stabilization mechanism and the structure invariance. Towards this end, we depart from the EL description of the systems and consider instead port-controlled Hamiltonian models, which result from the network modelling of energy-conserving lumped-parameter physical systems with independent storage elements, and strictly contain the class of EL models. {\textcopyright} 2002 Published by Elsevier Science Ltd.},

The empirical Galerkin model is based on an eight-dimensional Karhunen-Lo?ve decomposition of a numerical simulation and incorporates a new 'shift-mode' representing the mean-field correction. The inclusion of the shift-mode significantly improves the resolution of the transient dynamics from the onset of vortex shedding to the periodic von K?rm?n vortex street. In addition, the Reynolds-number dependence of the flow can be described with good accuracy. The inclusion of stability eigenmodes further enhances the accuracy of fluctuation dynamics. Mathematical and physical system reduction approaches lead to invariant-manifold and to mean-field models, respectively. The corresponding two-dimensional dynamical systems are further reduced to the Landau amplitude equation.},

The asymptotic analysis treats the stretched Burger's vortex sheet for strain rates much greater than the gradient of the sheet strength. It is found that portions of the sheet where the strength density is sufficiently large compared to (viscosity x strain rate)½ will collapse to form concentrated vortices. The exact solutions describe uniform vortices of elliptical cross-section in inviscid fluid subject to stretching parallel to their axes. These solutions complement the description of vortex collapse found by asymptotic methods. The relevance of these results stems from the prevalence of vortex structures subject to strain in turbulent flows.},

abstract = {A networked oscillator based analysis is performed for periodic bluff body flows to examine and control the transfer of kinetic energy. Spatial modes extracted from the flow field with corresponding amplitudes form a set of oscillators describing unsteady fluctuations. These oscillators are connected through a network that captures the energy exchanges amongst them. To extract the network of interactions among oscillators, amplitude and phase perturbations are impulsively introduced to the oscillators and the ensuing dynamics are analyzed. Using linear regression techniques, a networked oscillator model is constructed that reveals energy transfers and phase interactions among the modes. The model captures the nonlinear interactions amongst the modal oscillators through a linear approximation. A large collection of system responses are aggregated into a network model that captures interactions for general perturbations. The networked oscillator model describes the modal perturbation dynamics better than the empirical Galerkin reduced-order models. A model-based feedback controller is then designed to suppress modal amplitudes and the resulting wake unsteadiness leading to drag reduction. The strength of the proposed approach is demonstrated for a canonical example of two- dimensional unsteady flow over a circular cylinder. The present formulation enables the characterization of modal interactions to control fundamental energy transfers in unsteady vortical flows.},

abstract = {Direct Numerical Simulations (DNS) of the Navier Stokes equations is an invaluable research tool in fluid dynamics. Still, there are few publicly available research codes and, due to the heavy number crunching implied, available codes are usually written in low-level languages such as C/C++ or Fortran. In this paper we describe a pure scientific Python pseudo-spectral DNS code that nearly matches the performance of C++ for thousands of processors and billions of unknowns. We also describe a version optimized through Cython, that is found to match the speed of C++. The solvers are written from scratch in Python, both the mesh, the MPI domain decomposition, and the temporal integrators. The solvers have been verified and benchmarked on the Shaheen supercomputer at the KAUST supercomputing laboratory, and we are able to show very good scaling up to several thousand cores. A very important part of the implementation is the mesh decomposition (we implement both slab and pencil decompositions) and 3D parallel Fast Fourier Transforms (FFT). The mesh decomposition and FFT routines have been implemented in Python using serial FFT routines (either NumPy, pyFFTW or any other serial FFT module), NumPy array manipulations and with MPI communications handled by MPI for Python (mpi4py). We show how we are able to execute a 3D parallel FFT in Python for a slab mesh decomposition using 4 lines of compact Python code, for which the parallel performance on Shaheen is found to be slightly better than similar routines provided through the FFTW library. For a pencil mesh decomposition 7 lines of code is required to execute a transform.},

Rudimentary concepts of finite-degree-of-freedom Hamiltonian dynamics are reviewed, in the context of the passive advection of a scalar or tracer field by a fluid. The notions of integrability, invariant-tori, chaos, overlap criteria, and invariant-tori breakup are described in this context. Preparatory to the introduction of field theories, systems with an infinite number of degrees of freedom, elements of functional calculus and action principles of mechanics are reviewed. The action principle for the ideal compressible fluid is described in terms of Lagrangian or material variables. Hamiltonian systems in terms of noncanonical variables are presented, including several examples of Eulerian or inviscid fluid dynamics. Lie group theory sufficient for the treatment of reduction is reviewed. The reduction from Lagrangian to Eulerian variables is treated along with Clebsch variable decompositions. Stability in the canonical and noncanonical Hamiltonian contexts is described. Sufficient conditions for stability, such as Rayleigh-like criteria, are seen to be only sufficient in the general case because of the existence of negative-energy modes, which are possessed by interesting fluid equilibria. Linearly stable equilibria with negative energy modes are argued to be unstable when nonlinearity or dissipation is added. The energy-Casimir method is discussed and a variant of it that depends upon the notion of dynamical accessibility is described. The energy content of a perturbation about a general fluid equilibrium is calculated using three methods.},

abstract = { The ability of linear stochastic response analysis to estimate coherent motions is investigated in turbulent channel flow at the friction Reynolds number    $\text{Re}_{\unicode[STIX]{x1D70F}}=1007$   . The analysis is performed for spatial scales characteristic of buffer-layer and large-scale motions by separating the contributions of different temporal frequencies. Good agreement between the measured spatio-temporal power spectral densities and those estimated by means of the resolvent is found when the effect of turbulent Reynolds stresses, modelled with an eddy-viscosity associated with the turbulent mean flow, is included in the resolvent operator. The agreement is further improved when the flat forcing power spectrum (white noise) is replaced with a power spectrum matching the measures. Such a good agreement is not observed when the eddy-viscosity terms are not included in the resolvent operator. In this case, the estimation based on the resolvent is unable to select the right peak frequency and wall-normal location of buffer-layer motions. Similar results are found when comparing truncated expansions of measured streamwise velocity power spectral densities based on a spectral proper orthogonal decomposition to those obtained with optimal resolvent modes. },

abstract = {In recent years there has been significant progress made towards understanding the large-scale structure of wall-bounded shear flows. Most of this work has been conducted with turbulent boundary layers, leaving scope for further work in pipes and channels. In this article the structure of fully developed turbulent pipe and channel flow has been studied using custom-made arrays of hot-wire probes. Results reveal long meandering structures of length up to 25 pipe radii or channel half-heights. These appear to be qualitatively similar to those reported in the log region of a turbulent boundary layer. However, for the channel case, large-scale coherence persists further from the wall than in boundary layers. This is expected since these large-scale features are a property of the logarithmic region of the mean velocity profile in boundary layers and it is well-known that the mean velocity in a channel remains very close to the log law much further from the wall. Further comparison of the three turbulent flows shows that the characteristic structure width in the logarithmic region of a boundary layer is at least 1.6 times smaller than that in a pipe or channel.},

abstract = {By reformulating the Steepest-Entropy-Ascent (SEA) dynamical model for non-equilibrium thermodynamics in the mathematical language of Differential Geometry, we compare it with the primitive formulation of the GENERIC model and discuss the main technical differences of the two approaches. In both dynamical models the description of dissipation is of the "entropy-gradient" type. SEA focuses only onto the irreversible component of the time evolution, chooses a sub-Riemannian metric tensor as dissipative structure, and uses the local entropy density field as potential. GENERIC emphasizes the coupling between the reversible and irreversible components of the time evolution, chooses two compatible degenerate structures (Poisson and degenerate co-Riemannian), and uses the global energy and entropy functionals as potentials. As an illustration, we rewrite the known GENERIC formulation of the Boltzmann Equation in terms of the square-root of the distribution function adopted by the SEA formulation. We then provide a formal proof that in more general frameworks, whenever all degeneracies in the GENERIC framework are related to conservation laws, the SEA and GENERIC models of the irreversible component of the dynamics are essentially interchangeable, provided of course they assume the same kinematics. As part of the discussion, we note that equipping the dissipative structure of GENERIC with the Leibniz identity makes it automatically SEA on metric leaves.},

abstract = {The proper orthogonal decomposition technique (Lumley's decomposition) is applied to the turbulent flow in a channel, to extract coherent structures by decomposing the velocity field into characteristic eddies with random coefficients. In the homogeneous spatial directions a generalization of the shot-noise expansion is used to determine the characteristic eddies. In this expansion the Fourier coefficients of the characteristic eddy cannot be obtained from second-order statistics. Three different techniques are used to determine the phases of these coefficients: (i) a technique based on the bispectrum, (ii) a spatial compactness requirement, and (iii) a functional continuity argument. Results from these three techniques are found to be very similar. The implications of these techniques and the shot-noise expansion are discussed in the Appendix. The dominant eddy is found to contribute as much as 76% to the turbulent kinetic energy. In two and three dimensions, the characteristic eddies consist of an ejection region straddled by streamwise vortices which leave the wall in a very short streamwise distance of approximately 100 wall units.},

abstract = {In this paper, we investigate theoretically and computationally the conservation properties of reduced order models (ROMs) for fluid flows. Specifically, we investigate whether the ROMs satisfy the same (or similar) energy balance and mass conservation as those satisfied by the Navier–Stokes equations. All of our theoretical findings are illustrated and tested in numerical simulations of a 2D flow past a circular cylinder at a Reynolds number Re=100. First, we investigate the ROM energy balance. We show that using the snapshot average for the centering trajectory (which is a popular treatment of nonhomogeneous boundary conditions in ROMs) yields an incorrect energy balance. Then, we propose a new approach, in which we replace the snapshot average with the Stokes extension. Theoretically, the Stokes extension produces an accurate energy balance. Numerically, the Stokes extension yields more accurate results than the standard snapshot average, especially for longer time intervals. Our second contribution centers around ROM mass conservation. We consider ROMs created using two types of finite elements: the standard Taylor–Hood (TH) element, which satisfies the mass conservation weakly, and the Scott–Vogelius (SV) element, which satisfies the mass conservation pointwise. Theoretically, the error estimates for the SV-ROM are sharper than those for the TH-ROM. Numerically, the SV-ROM yields significantly more accurate results, especially for coarser meshes and longer time intervals.},

abstract = {We study the Reynolds number scaling and the geometric self-similarity of a gain-based, low-rank approximation to turbulent channel flows, determined by the resolvent formulation of McKeon & Sharma (2010), in order to obtain a description of the streamwise turbulence intensity from direct consideration of the Navier-Stokes equations. Under this formulation, the velocity field is decomposed into propagating waves (with single streamwise and spanwise wavelengths and wave speed) whose wall-normal shapes are determined from the principal singular function of the corresponding resolvent operator. Using the accepted scalings of the mean velocity in wall-bounded turbulent flows, we establish that the resolvent operator admits three classes of wave parameters that induce universal behavior with Reynolds number on the low-rank model, and which are consistent with scalings proposed throughout the wall turbulence literature. In addition, it was shown that a necessary condition for geometrically self-similar resolvent modes is the presence of a logarithmic turbulent mean velocity. We identify the scalings that constitute hierarchies of self-similar modes that are parameterized by the critical wall-normal location where the speed of the mode equals the local turbulent mean velocity. For the rank-1 model subject to broadband forcing, the integrated streamwise energy density takes a universal form which is consistent with the dominant near-wall turbulent motions. When the shape of the forcing is optimized to enforce matching with results from direct numerical simulations at low turbulent Reynolds numbers, further similarity appears. Representation of these weight functions using similarity laws enables prediction of the Reynolds number and wall-normal variations of the streamwise energy intensity at high Reynolds numbers (${Re}_\tau \approx 10^3 - 10^{10}$).},

abstract = {Over the last two decades, both experiments and simulations have demonstrated that transverse wall oscillations with properly selected amplitude and frequency can reduce turbulent drag by as much as 40 %. In this paper, we develop a model-based approach for designing oscillations that suppress turbulence in a channel flow. We utilize eddy- viscosity-enhanced linearization of the turbulent flow with control in conjunction with turbulence modelling to determine skin-friction drag in a simulation-free manner. The Boussinesq eddy viscosity hypothesis is used to quantify the effect of fluctuations on the mean velocity in flow subject to control. In contrast to the traditional approach that relies on numerical simulations, we determine the turbulent viscosity from the second- order statistics of the linearized model driven by white-in-time stochastic forcing. The spatial power spectrum of the forcing is selected to ensure that the linearized model for uncontrolled flow reproduces the turbulent energy spectrum. The resulting correction to the turbulent mean velocity induced by small-amplitude wall movements is then used to identify the optimal frequency of drag-reducing oscillations. In addition, the control net efficiency and the turbulent flow structures that we obtain agree well with the results of numerical simulations and experiments. This demonstrates the predictive power of our model-based approach to controlling turbulent flows and is expected to pave the way for successful flow control at higher Reynolds numbers than currently possible.},

abstract = {To reveal the scale dependence of the transport of turbulent kinetic energy in a channel flow, the constituents of a spectral energy budget equation are evaluated using direct numerical simulations. At each height in the buffer and overlap layers, the upward turbulent transport provides energy to the fluctuations at small scales, but removes it from those at large scales. Energy removed from the large scales in the overlap layer is carried upward to the centre of the channel and also downward to the vicinity of the wall. The downward energy fluxes at the large scales result in the well-known anomaly of turbulence intensity and the constituents of the budget equation near the wall. In the overlap layer the cospectrum of the spatial turbulent transport is scaled well by the mixing length. It shows that the structure of fluctuations involved in turbulent transport is self-similar in this layer, supporting the classical assumption. The cospectra of pressure–strain correlations are also evaluated. They are not scaled by the wall unit near the wall, but no symptom of the influence of large-scale structures is observed in the cospectra, at least for the present range of Reynolds numbers. Above the buffer layer the cospectra of the pressure–strain correlations are almost isotropic, and their relevant length scale is given by the mixing length in the overlap layer. The pressure–strain correlations are therefore rather local quantities.},

abstract = {This article reviews theory and applications of Koopman modes in fluid mechanics. Koopman mode decomposition is based on the surprising fact, discovered in Mezi{\'{c}} (2005), that normal modes of linear oscillations have their natural analogsKoopman modesin the context of nonlinear dynamics. To pursue this analogy, one must change the representation of the system from the state-space representation to the dynamics governed by the linear Koopman operator on an infinite-dimensional space of observables. Whereas Koopman in his original paper dealt only with measure-preserving transformations, the discussion here is predominantly on dissipative systems arising from Navier-Stokes evolution. The analysis is based on spectral properties of the Koopman operator. Aspects of point and continuous parts of the spectrum are discussed. The point spectrum corresponds to isolated frequencies of oscillation present in the fluid flow, and also to growth rates of stable and unstable modes. The continuous part of the spectrum corresponds to chaotic motion on the attractor. A method of computation of the spectrum and the associated Koopman modes is discussed in terms of generalized Laplace analysis. When applied to a generic observable, this method uncovers the full point spectrum. A computational alternative is given by Arnoldi-type methods, leading to so-called dynamic mode decomposition, and I discuss the connection and differences between these two methods. A number of applications are reviewed in which decompositions of this type have been pursued. Koopman mode theory unifies and provides a rigorous background for a number of different concepts that have been advanced in fluid mechanics, including global mode analysis, triple decomposition, and dynamic mode decomposition.},

abstract = {A model-based description of the scaling and radial location of turbulent fluctuations in turbulent pipe flow is presented and used to illuminate the scaling behaviour of the very large scale motions. The model is derived by treating the nonlinearity in the perturbation equation (involving the Reynolds stress) as an unknown forcing, yielding a linear relationship between the velocity field response and this nonlinearity. We do not assume small perturbations. We examine propagating modes, permitting comparison of our results to experimental data, and identify the steady component of the velocity field that varies only in the wall-normal direction as the turbulent mean profile. The "optimal" forcing shape, that gives the largest velocity response, is assumed to lead to modes that will be dominant and hence observed in turbulent pipe flow. An investigation of the most amplified velocity response at a given wavenumber-frequency combination reveals critical layer-like behaviour reminiscent of the neutrally stable solutions of the Orr-Sommerfeld equation in linearly unstable flow. Two distinct regions in the flow where the influence of viscosity becomes important can be identified, namely a wall layer that scales with $R^{+1/2}$ and a critical layer, where the propagation velocity is equal to the local mean velocity, that scales with $R^{+2/3}$ in pipe flow. This framework appears to be consistent with several scaling results in wall turbulence and reveals a mechanism by which the effects of viscosity can extend well beyond the immediate vicinity of the wall.},

abstract = {In this paper we investigate the relationship between the large- and small-scale energy-containing motions in wall turbulence. Recent studies in a high-Reynolds-number turbulent boundary layer (Hutchins & Marusic, Phil. Trans. R. Soc. Lond. A, vol. 365, 2007a, pp. 647–664) have revealed a possible influence of the large-scale boundary-layer motions on the small-scale near-wall cycle, akin to a pure amplitude modulation. In the present study we build upon these observations, using the Hilbert transformation applied to the spectrally filtered small-scale component of fluctuating velocity signals, in order to quantify the interaction. In addition to the large-scale log-region structures superimposing a footprint (or mean shift) on the near-wall fluctuations (Townsend, The Structure of Turbulent Shear Flow, 2nd edn., 1976, Cambridge University Press; Metzger & Klewicki, Phys. Fluids, vol. 13, 2001, pp. 692–701.), we find strong supporting evidence that the small-scale structures are subject to a high degree of amplitude modulation seemingly originating from the much larger scales that inhabit the log region. An analysis of the Reynolds number dependence reveals that the amplitude modulation effect becomes progressively stronger as the Reynolds number increases. This is demonstrated through three orders of magnitude in Reynolds number, from laboratory experiments at Re$\tau$ $\sim$ 103–104 to atmospheric surface layer measurements at Re$\tau$ $\sim$ 106.},

abstract = {Metriplectic dynamics couple a Poisson bracket of the Hamiltonian description with a kind of metric bracket, for describing systems with both Hamiltonian and dissipative components. The construction builds in asymptotic convergence to a preselected equilibrium state. Phenomena such as friction, electric resistivity, thermal conductivity and collisions in kinetic theories all fit within this framework. In this paper an application of metriplectic dynamics is presented that is of interest for the theory of control: a suitably chosen torque, expressed through a metriplectic extension of its "natural" Poisson algebra, an algebra obtained by reduction of a canonical Hamiltonian system, is applied to a free rigid body. On a practical ground, the effect is to drive the body to align its angular velocity to rotation about a stable principal axis of inertia, while conserving its kinetic energy in the process. On theoretical grounds, this example provides a class of non-Hamiltonian torques that can be added to the canonical Hamiltonian description of the free rigid body and reduce to metriplectic dissipation. In the canonical description these torques provide convergence to a higher dimensional attractor. The method of construction of such torques can be extended to other dynamical systems describing "machines" with non-Hamiltonian motion having attractors.},

abstract = {{\textcopyright} 2015 by the author. The dynamics of dissipative fluids in Eulerian variables may be derived from an algebra of Leibniz brackets of observables, the metriplectic algebra, that extends the Poisson algebra of the frictionless limit of the system via a symmetric semidefinite component, encoding dissipative forces. The metriplectic algebra includes the conserved total Hamiltonian H, generating the non-dissipative part of dynamics, and the entropy S of those microscopic degrees of freedom draining energy irreversibly, which generates dissipation. This S is a Casimir invariant of the Poisson algebra to which the metriplectic algebra reduces in the frictionless limit. The role of S is as paramount as that of H, but this fact may be underestimated in the Eulerian formulation because S is not the only Casimir of the symplectic non-canonical part of the algebra. Instead, when the dynamics of the non-ideal fluid is written through the parcel variables of the Lagrangian formulation, the fact that entropy is symplectically invariant clearly appears to be related to its dependence on the microscopic degrees of freedom of the fluid, that are themselves in involution with the position and momentum of the parcel.},

abstract = {{\textcopyright} 2016 by the author. This lecture is a short review on the role entropy plays in those classical dissipative systems whose equations of motion may be expressed via a Leibniz Bracket Algebra (LBA). This means that the time derivative of any physical observable f of the system is calculated by putting this f in a "bracket" together with a "special observable" F, referred to as a Leibniz generator of the dynamics. While conservative dynamics is given an LBA formulation in the Hamiltonian framework, so that F is the Hamiltonian H of the system that generates the motion via classical Poisson brackets or quantum commutation brackets, an LBA formulation can be given to classical dissipative dynamics through the Metriplectic Bracket Algebra (MBA): the conservative component of the dynamics is still generated via Poisson algebra by the total energy H, while S, the entropy of the degrees of freedom statistically encoded in friction, generates dissipation via a metric bracket. The motivation of expressing through a bracket algebra and a motion-generating function F is to endow the theory of the system at hand with all the powerful machinery of Hamiltonian systems in terms of symmetries that become evident and readable. Here a (necessarily partial) overview of the types of systems subject to MBA formulation is presented, and the physical meaning of the quantity S involved in each is discussed. Here the aim is to review the different MBAs for isolated systems in a synoptic way. At the end of this collection of examples, the fact that dissipative dynamics may be constructed also in the absence of friction with microscopic degrees of freedom is stressed. This reasoning is a hint to introduce dissipation at a more fundamental level.},

From this simple hypothesis, the attached eddy model evolved, which has proven to be highly effective in predicting velocity statistics and providing a framework for interpreting the energy-containing flow physics at high Reynolds numbers. This review summarizes the hypothesis itself and the modeling attempts made thereafter, with a focus on the validity of the model's assumptions and its limitations.

abstract = {Wall-bounded turbulent flows at high Reynolds numbers have become an increasingly active area of research in recent years. Many challenges remain in theory, scaling, physical understanding, experimental techniques, and numerical simulations. In this paper we distill the salient advances of recent origin, particularly those that challenge textbook orthodoxy. Some of the outstanding questions, such as the extent of the logarithmic overlap layer, the universality or otherwise of the principal model parameters such as the von K{\'{a}}rm{\'{a}}n “constant,” the parametrization of roughness effects, and the scaling of mean flow and Reynolds stresses, are highlighted. Research avenues that may provide answers to these questions, notably the improvement of measuring techniques and the construction of new facilities, are identified. We also highlight aspects where differences of opinion persist, with the expectation that this discussion might mark the beginning of their resolution.},

abstract = {—Inferring the structure and dynamics of network models is critical to understanding the functionality and control of complex systems, such as metabolic and regulatory biological networks. The increasing quality and quantity of experimental data enable statistical approaches based on information theory for model selection and goodness-of-fit metrics. We propose an alternative data-driven method to infer networked nonlinear dynamical systems by using sparsity-promoting optimization to select a subset of nonlinear interactions representing dynamics on a network. In contrast to standard model selection methods-based upon information content for a finite number of heuristic models (order 10 or less), our model selection procedure discov-ers a parsimonious model from a combinatorially large set of models, without an exhaustive search. Our particular innovation is appropriate for many biological networks, where the govern-ing dynamical systems have rational function nonlinearities with cross terms, thus requiring an implicit formulation and the equa-tions to be identified in the null-space of a library of mixed nonlinearities, including the state and derivative terms. This method, implicit-SINDy, succeeds in inferring three canonical biological models: 1) Michaelis–Menten enzyme kinetics; 2) the regulatory network for competence in bacteria; and 3) the metabolic network for yeast glycolysis.},

The homogenization theory for periodic velocity fields and random velocity fields with short-range correlations is presented and utilized to examine subtle ways in which the flow geometry can influence the large-scale effective scalar diffusivity. Various forms of anomalous diffusion are then illustrated in some exactly solvable random velocity field models with long-range correlations similar to those present in fully developed turbulence. Here both random shear layer models with special geometry but general correlation structure as well as isotropic rapidly decorrelating models are emphasized. Some of the issues studied in detail in these models are superdiffusive and subdiffusive transport, pair dispersion, fractal dimensions of scalar interfaces, spectral scaling regimes, small-scale and large-scale scalar intermittency, and qualitative behavior over finite time intervals. Finally, it is demonstrated how exactly solvable models can be applied to test and design numerical simulation strategies and theoretical closure approximations for turbulent diffusion. {\textcopyright} 1999 Elsevier Science B.V.

We use the two-dimensional (2-D) linear coherence spectrum (LCS) to perform the comparison over a wide range of energy-carrying streamwise and spanwise length scales. The study of the 2-D LCS from DNS indicates the presence of large-scale structures that are coherent over large wall-normal distances and that are self-similar. We find that, with the addition of an eddy viscosity profile, these features of the large-scale structures are captured by the linearized equations, except in the region close to the wall. To further study this coherence, a coherence-based estimation technique, spectral linear stochastic estimation, is used to build linear estimators from the linearized Navier–Stokes equations. The estimator uses the instantaneous streamwise velocity field or the 2-D streamwise energy spectrum at one wall-normal location (obtained from DNS) to predict the same quantity at a different wall-normal location. We find that the addition of an eddy viscosity profile significantly improves the estimation. </p>},

It is applicable to inertial measurement units (IMUs) consisting of tri-axis gyroscopes and accelerometers, and magnetic angular rate and gravity (MARG) sensor arrays that also include tri-axis magnetometers. The MARG implementation incorporates magnetic distortion compensation. The algorithm uses a quaternion representation, allowing accelerometer and magnetometer data to be used in an analytically derived and optimised gradient descent algorithm to compute the direction of the gyroscope measurement error as a quaternion derivative. Performance has been evaluated empirically using a commercially available orientation sensor and reference measurements of orientation obtained using an optical measurement system. Performance was also benchmarked against the propriety Kalman-based algorithm of orientation sensor. Results indicate the algorithm achieves levels of accuracy matching that of the Kalman based algorithm; < 0.8° static RMS error, < 1.7° dynamic RMS error. The implications of the low computational load and ability to operate at small sampling rates significantly reduces the hardware and power necessary for wearable inertial movement tracking, enabling the creation of lightweight, inexpensive systems capable of functioning for extended periods of time.},

abstract = { A numerical study is made of the temporal eigenvalue spectrum of the Orr-Sommerfeld equation for the Blasius boundary layer. Unlike channel flows, there is no mathematical proof that this flow has an infinite spectrum of discrete eigenvalues. The Orr-Sommerfeld equation is integrated numerically, and the eigenvalues located by tracing out the contour lines in the complex wave velocity ( c = c  r  + ic  i  ) plane on which the real and imaginary parts of the secular determinant are zero. This method gives only a finite and small number of discrete eigenvalues for a wide range of Reynolds numbers and wavenumbers. The spectrum of plane Poiseuille flow is used as a guide to study the spectrum of an artificial two wall flow which consists of two Blasius boundary layers. As the upper boundary of this flow moves to infinity, it is found that the portion of the spectrum with an infinite number of eigenvalues moves towards c  r  = 1 and the spacing between eigenvalues goes to zero. It is concluded, on the basis of this result and the contour method, that the original few eigenvalues found are the only discrete eigenvalues that exist for Blasius flow over a wide portion of the c plane for c  r  < 1 and c  r  > 1. It is suggested that the discrete spectrum is supplemented by a continuous spectrum which lies along the c  r  = 1 axis for c  i  < −$\alpha$/ R . },

The energy-Casimir method is first proposed to deal with power preserving systems. It is shown how to use finite dimensional dynamic boundary controllers and closed-loop structural invariants to partially shape the closed-loop energy function and how such controller finally reduces to a state feedback. When dissipative port-Hamiltonian systems are considered, the Casimir functions do not exist anymore (dissipation obstacle) and the immersion (via a dynamic controller) / reduction (through invariants) method cannot be applied. The main contribution of this paper is to show how to use the same ideas and state functions to shape the closed-loop energy function of dissipative systems through direct state feedback i.e. without relying on a dynamic controller and a reduction step. In both cases the existence of solution and the asymptotic stability (by additional damping injection) of the closed-loop system are proven. The general theory and achievable closed-loop performances are illustrated with the help of a concluding example, the boundary stabilisation of a longitudinal beam vibrations.},

The method constructs a closed reduced Hamiltonian system by coupling the full model with a canonical heat bath. This allows the reduced system to be integrated with a symplectic integrator, resulting in a correct dissipation of energy, preservation of the total energy and, ultimately, in the stability of the solution. Accuracy and stability of the method are illustrated through the numerical simulation of the dissipative wave equation and a port-Hamiltonian model of an electric circuit.},

It is shown that, when various criteria such as that of Lin are satisfied, all but one of these mechanisms, the fluctuation of convection velocity, can be disregarded at high frequencies. An analytical model of this mechanism is constructed and several of its properties examined. On the basis of this model, a correction formula is obtained for the high‐frequency part of the one‐dimensional streamwise spectrum. This is applied to experimental data taken in a curved turbulent mixing layer. It is found that even under extreme circumstances corrections from this source are not likely to exceed 30%.},

abstract = {This paper employs the theoretical framework developed by Luhar et al. (2015, J. Fluid Meck, 768, 415-441) to consider the design of compliant walls for turbulent skin friction reduction. Specifically, the effects of simple springdamper walls are contrasted with the effects of more complex walls incorporating tension, stiffness and anisotropy. Despite the differing physical responses, all the walls tested exhibit two important common features. First, the effect of the walls (positive or negative) is greatest at conditions close to resonance, with sharp transitions in performance across the resonant frequency or phase speed. In general, turbulent flow structures with frequencies (or phase speeds) below resonance are further amplified, while higher-frequency structures are suppressed. Compliant walls are also predicted to have a more pronounced effect on the slowermoving low frequency structures because such structures generally have larger wall-pressure signatures. Second, two-dimensional (spanwise constant) structures are particularly susceptible to further amplification. This is consistent with previous experiments and simulations, suggesting that mitigating the rise of such two-dimensional structures is essential to designing performance-improving walls. The above observations are used to develop specific design guidelines for compliant walls.},

@article{Lozano-Duran2014,
abstract = {{\textcopyright} Cambridge University Press 2014. A novel approach to the study of the kinematics and dynamics of turbulent flows is presented. The method involves tracking in time coherent structures, and provides all of the information required to characterize eddies from birth to death. Spatially and temporally well-resolved DNSs of channel data at Re$\tau$ = 930-4200 are used to analyse the evolution of three-dimensional sweeps, ejections (Lozano-Dur{\'{a}}n et al., J. Fluid Mech., vol. 694, 2012, pp. 100-130) and clusters of vortices (del {\'{A}}lamo et al., J. Fluid Mech., vol. 561, 2006, pp. 329-358). The results show that most of the eddies remain small and do not last for long times, but that some become large, attach to the wall and extend across the logarithmic layer. The latter are geometrically and temporally self-similar, with lifetimes proportional to their size (or distance from the wall), and their dynamics is controlled by the mean shear near their centre of gravity. They are responsible for most of the total momentum transfer. Their origin, eventual disappearance, and history are investigated and characterized, including their advection velocity at different wall distances and the temporal evolution of their size. Reinforcing previous results, the symmetry found between sweeps and ejections supports the idea that they are not independent structures, but different manifestations of larger quasi-streamwise rollers in which they are embedded. Spatially localized direct and inverse cascades are respectively associated with the splitting and merging of individual structures, as in the models of Richardson (Proc. R. Soc. Lond. A, vol. 97(686), 1920, pp. 354-373) or Obukhov (Izv. Akad. Nauk USSR, Ser. Geogr. Geofiz., vol. 5(4), 1941, pp. 453-466). It is found that the direct cascade predominates, but that both directions are roughly comparable. Most of the merged or split fragments have sizes of the order of a few Kolmogorov viscous units, but a substantial fraction of the growth and decay of the larger eddies is due to a self-similar inertial process in which eddies merge and split in fragments spanning a wide range of scales.},

abstract = {<p>The sparse identification of nonlinear dynamics (SINDy) is a recently proposed data-driven modelling framework that uses sparse regression techniques to identify nonlinear low-order models. With the goal of low-order models of a fluid flow, we combine this approach with dimensionality reduction techniques (e.g. proper orthogonal decomposition) and extend it to enforce physical constraints in the regression, e.g. energy-preserving quadratic nonlinearities. The resulting models, hereafter referred to as Galerkin regression models, incorporate many beneficial aspects of Galerkin projection, but without the need for a high-fidelity solver to project the Navier–Stokes equations. Instead, the most parsimonious nonlinear model is determined that is consistent with observed measurement data and satisfies necessary constraints. Galerkin regression models also readily generalize to include higher-order nonlinear terms that model the effect of truncated modes. The effectiveness of such an approach is demonstrated on two canonical flow configurations: the two-dimensional flow past a circular cylinder and the shear-driven cavity flow. For both cases, the accuracy of the identified models compare favourably against reduced-order models obtained from a standard Galerkin projection procedure. Finally, the entire code base for our constrained sparse Galerkin regression algorithm is freely available online.</p>},

Here, we test the small molecule flexible ligand docking program Glide on a set of 19 non-$\alpha$-helical peptides and systematically improve pose prediction accuracy by enhancing Glide sampling for flexible polypeptides. In addition, scoring of the poses was improved by post-processing with physics-based implicit solvent MM- GBSA calculations. Using the best RMSD among the top 10 scoring poses as a metric, the success rate (RMSD ≤ 2.0 {\AA} for the interface backbone atoms) increased from 21% with default Glide SP settings to 58% with the enhanced peptide sampling and scoring protocol in the case of redocking to the native protein structure. This approaches the accuracy of the recently developed Rosetta FlexPepDock method (63% success for these 19 peptides) while being over 100 times faster. Cross-docking was performed for a subset of cases where an unbound receptor structure was available, and in that case, 40% of peptides were docked successfully. We analyze the results and find that the optimized polypeptide protocol is most accurate for extended peptides of limited size and number of formal charges, defining a domain of applicability for this approach.},

Although control theory offers mathematical tools for steering engineered and natural systems towards a desired state, a framework to control complex self-organized systems is lacking. Here we develop analytical tools to study the controllability of an arbitrary complex directed network, identifying the set of driver nodes with time-dependent control that can guide the system's entire dynamics. We apply these tools to several real networks, finding that the number of driver nodes is determined mainly by the network's degree distribution. We show that sparse inhomogeneous networks, which emerge in many real complex systems, are the most difficult to control, but that dense and homogeneous networks can be controlled using a few driver nodes. Counterintuitively, we find that in both model and real systems the driver nodes tend to avoid the high-degree nodes.},

With deep roots in nonlinear dynamics and control theory, notions of control and controllability have taken a new life recently in the study of complex networks, inspiring several fundamental questions: What are the control principles of complex systems? How do networks organize themselves to balance control with functionality? To address these here we review recent advances on the controllability and the control of complex networks, exploring the intricate interplay between a system's structure, captured by its network topology, and the dynamical laws that govern the interactions between the components.

Although the simultaneous measurement of all internal variables, like all metabolite concentrations in a cell, offers a complete description of a system's state, in practice experimental access is limited to only a subset of variables, or sensors. A system is called observable if we can reconstruct the system's complete internal state from its outputs. Here, we adopt a graphical approach derived from the dynamical laws that govern a system to determine the sensors that are necessary to reconstruct the full internal state of a complex system. We apply this approach to biochemical reaction systems, finding that the identified sensors are not only necessary but also sufficient for observability. The developed approach can also identify the optimal sensors for target or partial observability, helping us reconstruct selected state variables from appropriately chosen outputs, a prerequisite for optimal biomarker design. Given the fundamental role observability plays in complex systems, these results offer avenues to systematically explore the dynamics of a wide range of natural, technological and socioeconomic systems.},

Relatively simple structures of quadrotors has promoted interest from academia, UAV industries, and radio-control (RC) hobbyists alike. Unlike conventional helicopters, swashplates, which are prone to failure without constant maintenance, are not required. Furthermore, the diameter of individual rotors can be reduced as a result of the presence of four actuators [8].},

abstract = {{\textcopyright} 2016 by the authors. Magnetic-Inertial Measurement Units (MIMUs) based on microelectromechanical (MEMS) technologies are widespread in contexts such as human motion tracking. Although they present several advantages (lightweight, size, cost), their orientation estimation accuracy might be poor. Indoor magnetic disturbances represent one of the limiting factors for their accuracy, and, therefore, a variety of work was done to characterize and compensate them. In this paper, the main compensation strategies included within Kalman-based orientation estimators are surveyed and classified according to which degrees of freedom are affected by the magnetic data and to the magnetic disturbance rejection methods implemented. By selecting a representative method from each category, four algorithms were obtained and compared in two different magnetic environments: (1) small workspace with an active magnetic source; (2) large workspace without active magnetic sources. A wrist-worn MIMU was used to acquire data from a healthy subject, whereas a stereophotogrammetric system was adopted to obtain ground-truth data. The results suggested that the model-based approaches represent the best compromise between the two testbeds. This is particularly true when the magnetic data are prevented to affect the estimation of the angles with respect to the vertical direction.},

abstract = {Pattern recognition generally requires that objects be described in terms of a set of measurable features. The selec- tion and quality of the features representing each pattern have a considerable bearing on the success of subsequent pattern classi- fication. Feature extraction is the process of deriving new features from the original features in order to reduce the cost of feature measurement, increase classifier efficiency, and allow higher clas- sification accuracy.Many current feature extraction techniques in- volve linear transformations of the original pattern vectors to new vectors of lower dimensionality. While this is useful for data visu- alization and increasing classification efficiency, it does not neces- sarily reduce the number of features that must be measured since each new feature may be a linear combination of all of the features in the original pattern vector. Here, we present a new approach to feature extraction in which feature selection, feature extraction, and classifier training are performed simultaneously using a ge- netic algorithm. The genetic algorithm optimizes a vector of fea- ture weights, which are used to scale the individual features in the original pattern vectors in either a linear or a nonlinear fashion. A masking vector is also employed to perform simultaneous selec- tion of a subset of the features.We employ this technique in com- bination with the nearest neighbor classification rule, and com- pare the results with classical feature selection and extraction tech- niques, including sequential floating forward feature selection, and linear discriminant analysis.We also present results for the iden- tification of favorable water-binding sites on protein surfaces, an important problem in biochemistry and drug design},

Measurements were taken at four different wall-normal locations ranging from y/d = 0.08–0.48 at a friction Reynolds number, Res = 410. The data set yielded statistically converged results over a larger field of view than typically observed in the literature. The method for identifying and tracking swirling coherent structure is discussed, and the resulting trajectories, con- vection velocities, and lifespan of these structures are analyzed at each wall-normal location. The ability of a model in which the entirety of an individual SCS travels at a single convection velocity, consistent with the attached eddy hypothesis of Townsend (The structure of turbulent shear flows. Cambridge University Press, Cambridge, 1976), to describe the data is investigated. A methodology for determining whether such structures are ‘‘attached'' or ‘‘detached'' from the wall is also proposed and used to measure the lifespan and convection velocity distributions of these different structures. SCS were found to persist for longer periods of time further from the wall, particularly those inferred to be ‘‘detached'' from the wall, which could be tracked for longer than 5 eddy turnover times.},

abstract = {Despite its importance in many applications, the nature of wall-bounded turbulent flow is not well-understood. The dynamics of near-wall turbulence has been well studied , with direct numerical simulation (DNS) making an important contribution. It has been difficult to study the interaction of near-wall and outer-layer turbulence via DNS because the Reynolds numbers available via DNS have not been sufficiently high to exhibit significant scale separation. In the work presented here, we correct that shortcoming. We have performed direct numerical simulation(DNS) of turbulent channel flow using a Fourier-Galerkin method in the streamwise(x) and spanwise (z) directions and a B-Splines collocation method in the wall-normal (y) direction. The highest Reynolds number based on shear velocity (u $\tau$ = $\tau$ w /$\rho$), Re $\tau$ is approximately 5200. To study the scale dependence of the dynamics of the Reynolds stress components, we applied a spectral analysis to the terms in the Reynolds stress transport equation (RSTE). Result shows that the large (or very large) scale motion has an important role in turbulent transport terms. Also, it has been observed that a non-trivial portion of turbulent kinetic energy (TKE) is transported to the near-wall region and dissipated by large scale motion.},

abstract = { The transport equations for the variances of the velocity components are investigated using data from direct numerical simulations of incompressible channel flows at friction Reynolds number (    $Re_{\unicode[STIX]{x1D70F}}$   ) up to    $Re_{\unicode[STIX]{x1D70F}}=5200$   . Each term in the transport equation has been spectrally decomposed to expose the contribution of turbulence at different length scales to the processes governing the flow of energy in the wall-normal direction, in scale and among components. The outer-layer turbulence is dominated by very large-scale streamwise elongated modes, which are consistent with the very large-scale motions (VLSM) that have been observed by many others. The presence of these VLSMs drives many of the characteristics of the turbulent energy flows. Away from the wall, production occurs primarily in these large-scale streamwise-elongated modes in the streamwise velocity, but dissipation occurs nearly isotropically in both velocity components and scale. For this to happen, the energy is transferred from the streamwise-elongated modes to modes with a range of orientations through nonlinear interactions, and then transferred to other velocity components. This allows energy to be transferred more-or-less isotropically from these large scales to the small scales at which dissipation occurs. The VLSMs also transfer energy to the wall region, resulting in a modulation of the autonomous near-wall dynamics and the observed Reynolds number dependence of the near-wall velocity variances. The near-wall energy flows are more complex, but are consistent with the well-known autonomous near-wall dynamics that gives rise to streaks and streamwise vortices. Through the overlap region between outer- and inner-layer turbulence, there is a self-similar structure to the energy flows. The VLSM production occurs at spanwise scales that grow with    $y$   . There is transport of energy away from the wall over a range of scales that grows with    $y$   . Moreover, there is transfer of energy to small dissipative scales which grows like    $y^{1/4}$   , as expected from Kolmogorov scaling. Finally, the small-scale near-wall processes characterised by wavelengths less than 1000 wall units are largely Reynolds number independent, while the larger-scale outer-layer processes are strongly Reynolds number dependent. The interaction between them appears to be relatively simple. },

abstract = {Direct numerical simulation of a turbulent boundary layer was performed to investigate the spatially coherent structures associated with very-large-scale motions (VLSMs). The Reynolds number was varied in the range Re$\theta$ =570–2560. The main simulation was conducted by using a computational box greater than 50$\delta$o in the streamwise domain, where $\delta$o is the boundary layer thickness at the inlet, and inflow data was obtained from a separate inflow simulation based on Lund's method. Inspection of the three-dimensional instantaneous fields showed that groups of hairpin vortices are coherently arranged in the streamwise direction and that these groups create significantly elongated low- and high-momentum regions with large amounts of Reynolds shear stress. Adjacent packet-type structures combine to form the VLSMs; this formation process is attributed to continuous stretching of the hairpins coupled with lifting-up and backward curling of the vortices. The growth of the spanwise scale of the hairpin packets occurs continuously, so it increases rapidly to double that of the original width of the packets. We employed the modified feature extraction algorithm developed by Ganapathisubramani, Longmire & Marusic (J. Fluid Mech., vol. 478, 2003, p. 35) to identify the properties of the VLSMs of hairpin vortices. In the log layer, patches with the length greater than 3$\delta$–4$\delta$ account for more than 40% of all the patches and these VLSMs contribute approximately 45% of the total Reynolds shear stress included in all the patches. The VLSMs have a statistical streamwise coherence of the order of ∼6$\delta$; the spatial organization and coherence decrease away from the wall, but the spanwise width increases monotonically with the wall-normal distance. Finally, the application of linear stochastic estimation demonstrated the presence of packet organization in the form of a train of packets in the log layer.},

abstract = {ABSTRACT A characteristic feature of the onset of turbulence in shear flows is the appearance of an ‘edge', a codimension-one invariant manifold that separates ‘lower' orbits, which decay directly to the laminar state, from ‘upper' orbits, which decay more slowly and less directly. The object of this paper is to elucidate the structure of the edge that makes this behaviour possible. To this end we consider a succession of low-dimensional models. In doing this we isolate geometric features that are robust under increase of dimension and are therefore candidates for explaining analogous features in higher dimension. We find that the edge, which is the stable manifold of a ‘lower-branch' state, winds endlessly around an ‘upper-branch' state in such a way that upper orbits are able to circumnavigate the edge and return to the laminar state.},

abstract = {The basin of attraction of a stable equilibrium point is investigated for a dynamical system (W97) that has been used to model transition to turbulence in shear flows. The basin boundary contains a linearly unstable equilibrium point X lb which, in the self-sustaining scenario, plays a role in mediating the transition in that transition orbits cluster around its unstable manifold. However we find� for W97 with canonical parameter values—that this role is played not by X lb but rather by a periodic orbit also lying on the basin boundary. Moreover, it appears via numerical computations that all orbits beginning near X lb relaminarize. We offer numerical evidence that the parameter values of W97 are post-critical in the following sense: for some, subcritical parameter values, the basin boundary coincides with the stable manifold of X lb and only a subset of nearby orbits relaminarize, whereas for supercritical values the basin boundary is the union of two stable manifolds, one belonging to the periodic orbit and dominating the basin boundary, and the other belonging to X lb and detectable only as edge separating relaminarizing orbits of different characters. The periodic orbit appears at the critical parameter value via a homoclinic connection. This further leads to a proposal for the structure of the 'edge of chaos' somewhat different from that which has previously been proposed.},

abstract = {We explore two low-dimensional dynamical systems modeling transition to turbulence in shear flows to try to understand the nature of the boundary ∂B of the basin of attraction B of the stable, laminar point at the origin of coordinates. Components of ∂B are found to exist in two types: one (the 'strong' type) separating B from a complementary set where orbits never relaminarize, and a second (the 'weak' type) separating B into two parts locally but not globally. For a boundary of weak type, orbits on each side relaminarize but may be distinguished from one another by features such as orbital complexity and time to relaminarize. The basin boundary may be of a single type, or may be a union of components of different types.The models are parametrized and may transform from one type to another at a critical parameter value. In the models studied here the change from purely strong type to a union of the two types occurs via the collapse of two sheets of a strong boundary into a single sheet. This is accompanied, at the critical value of the parameter, by the appearance of a homoclinic orbit and the subsequent occurrence of a periodic orbit on the strong part of the boundary. {\textcopyright} 2011 Elsevier B.V.},

@article{Lasagna2016,
abstract = { In this paper a novel nonlinear feedback control design methodology for incompressible fluid flows aiming at the optimisation of long-time averages of flow quantities is presented. It applies to reduced-order finite-dimensional models of fluid flows, expressed as a set of first-order nonlinear ordinary differential equations with the right-hand side being a polynomial function in the state variables and in the controls. The key idea, first discussed in Chernyshenko et al. ( Phil. Trans. R. Soc. Lond.  A, vol. 372, 2014, 20130350), is that the difficulties of treating and optimising long-time averages of a cost are relaxed by using the upper/lower bounds of such averages as the objective function. In this setting, control design reduces to finding a feedback controller that optimises the bound, subject to a polynomial inequality constraint involving the cost function, the nonlinear system, the controller itself and a tunable polynomial function. A numerically tractable and efficient approach to the solution of such optimisation problems, based on sum-of-squares techniques and semidefinite programming, is proposed. To showcase the methodology, the mitigation of the fluctuation kinetic energy in the unsteady wake behind a circular cylinder in the laminar regime at $Re=100$ , via controlled angular motions of the surface, is numerically investigated. A compact reduced-order model that resolves the long-term behaviour of the fluid flow and the effects of actuation, is first derived using proper orthogonal decomposition and Galerkin projection. In a full-information setting, feedback controllers are then designed to reduce the long-time average of the resolved kinetic energy associated with the limit cycle. These controllers are then implemented in direct numerical simulations of the actuated flow. Control performance, total energy efficiency and the physical control mechanisms identified are analysed in detail. Key elements of the methodology, implications and future work are finally discussed. },

abstract = {{Examples of coupled irreversible processes like the thermoelectric phenomena, the transference phenomena in electrolytes and heat conduction in an anisotropic medium are considered. For certain cases of such interaction reciprocal relations have been deduced by earlier writers, e,g. , Thomson's theory of thermoelectric phenomena and Helmholtz' theory for the e.m. f. of electrolytic cells with liquid junction. These earlier derivations may be classed as quasi-thermodynamic; in fact, Thomson himself pointed out that his argument was incomplete, and that: his relation ought to be established on an experimental basis. A general class of such relations will be derived by a new theoretical treatment from the principle of microscopic reversibility. ()$1-2.) The analogy with a chemical monomolecular triangle reaction is discussed; in this case a a simple kinetic consideration assuming microscopic reversibility yields a reciprocal relation that is not necessary for fulfilling the requirements of thermodynamics ($3). Reciprocal relations for heat conduction in an anisotropic medium are derived from the assumption of microscopic reversibility, applied to fluctuations. ($4.) The reciprocal relations can be expressed in terms of a potential, the dissipation-function. Lord Rayleigh's "principle of the least dissipation of energy" is generalized to include the case of anisotropic heat conduction. A further generalization is announced. ($5.} The conditions for stationary flow are formulated; the connection with earlier quasi-thermodynamic theories is discussed. ($6.) The principle of dynamical reversibility does not apply when (external) magnetic fields or Coriolis forces are present, and the reciprocal relations break down. ($7.)},

Judiciously chosen observables lead to physically interpretable spatio-temporal features of the complex system under consideration and provide a connection to manifold learning methods. We demonstrate the impact of observable selection, including kernel methods, and construction of the Koopman operator on two canonical, nonlinear PDEs: Burgers' equation and the nonlinear Schr\"odinger equation. These examples serve to highlight the most pressing and critical challenge of Koopman theory: a principled way to select appropriate observables.},

abstract = {Data from the near-wall-turbulent region of the high-Reynolds-number atmospheric surface layer are used to analyse the attached-eddy model of wall turbulence. All data were acquired during near-neutral conditions at the Surface Layer Turbulence and Environmental Science Test (SLTEST) facility located in the western Utah Great Salt Lake Desert. Instantaneous streamwise and wall-normal components of velocity were collected with a wall-normal array of two-component hot wires within the first 2m above the surface of the salt flats. Streamwise and wall-normal turbulence intensities and spectra are directly compared to corresponding laboratory data and similarity formulations hypothesized from the attached-eddy model of wall turbulence. This affords the opportunity to compare results with Reynolds numbers varying over three orders of magnitude. The wall-normal turbulence-intensity similarity formulation is extended. The results show good support for the similarity arguments forwarded by the attached-eddy model as well as Townsend's (1956) Reynolds-number similarity hypothesis and lack of the ‘inactive' motion influence on the wall-normal velocity component. The effects of wall roughness and the spread in the convection velocity due to this roughness are also discussed. 1.},

Traditional numerical integration algorithms, which are polynomials in the time step, typically lead to systematic drifts in the computed value of the total energy and angular momentum. Even symplectic integration schemes exactly conserve only an approximate Hamiltonian. We present an algorithm that conserves the true Hamiltonian and the total angular momentum to machine precision. It is derived by applying conventional discretizations in a new space obtained by transformation of the dependent variables. We develop the method first for the restricted circular three-body problem, then for the general two-dimensional three-body problem and finally for the planar n-body problem. Jacobi coordinates are used to reduce the two-dimensional n-body problem to an (n - 1)-body problem that incorporates the constant linear momentum and centre-of-mass constraints. For a four-body choreography, we find that a larger time step can be used with our conservative algorithm than with symplectic and conventional integrators.},

abstract = {Definition (Poincar{\'{e}} Map): Consider ˙ x = f (x) with periodic solution ¯ x(t). Construct a (n−1)-dimensional transversal $\Sigma$ to the corresponding closed orbit $\Gamma$. Let a be the point where $\Gamma$ intersects $\Sigma$. For an orbit $\phi$(x 0) starting at x 0 ∈ $\Sigma$ close to a, the phase flow will return to $\Sigma$. The first return or Poincar{\'{e}} map P : U ⊂ $\Sigma$ → $\Sigma$ is defined by P (x 0) = $\phi$($\tau$ ; x 0). Notice that a is a fixed point of the map P . P reduces the study of the stability of a periodic orbit ¯ x(t) to the study of the stability of a fixed point a. Definition (Stability of Periodic Orbits): The periodic solution ¯ x(t) (the closed orbit $\Gamma$) is stable if for each > 0, there exists a $\delta$ such that ||x 0 − a|| < $\delta$ ⇒ ||P n (x 0) − a|| < Definition: The periodic solution ¯ x(t) is asymptotically stable if it is stable and if there exists a $\delta$ > 0 such that ||x 0 − a|| < $\delta$ ⇒ lim n→∞ P n (x 0) = a. 1 Example: Consider the equation of forced linear oscillations + $\delta$ ˙ x + $\beta$x = $\gamma$ cos $\omega$t with $\delta$ = 2, $\beta$ = 2, $\gamma$ = 5, $\omega$ = 1. Remarks: • Two Poincar{\'{e}} maps for a periodic orbit are conjugate to each other. • Let the linearization of the discrete map P at the fixed point a be ∂P ∂x 0 (a). This linearized Poincar{\'{e}} map can be used to study the stability of the fixed point a as well as its corresponding periodic orbit. P (x 0) − a = ∂P ∂x 0 (a)(x 0 − a) + O(2). • Let $\lambda$ 1 , . . . , $\lambda$ n−1 be the eigenvalues of this linearized map. If the moduli of all eigenvalues are small than 1, then a is stable; if the modulus of at least one eigenvalues is larger than 1, then a is unstable. • To construct a Poincar{\'{e}} map analytically is not an easy task. For practical problems, numer-ical methods are generally needed. Poincar{\'{e}} sections have been widely used to study global orbit structure of low dimensional systems. 2 2 Floquet Theory The stability of periodic solution can also be studied in terms of the characteristic or Floquet multiplier. We will discuss some of the major results in the Floquet theory and link them up with the Poincar{\'{e}} map method via ∂P (a) ∂x 0 = ∂$\phi$(T a) x 0 = $\Phi$(T). (2.0.1) Recall the Example:},

abstract = {MEMS gyroscopes are gaining popularity because of their low manufacturing costs in large quantities. For navigation system engineering, this presents a challenge because of strong nonstationary noise processes, such as 1/f noise, in the output ofMEMS gyros. In practice, on-the-fly calibration is often required before the gyroscope data are useful and comparable to more expensive optical gyroscopes. In this paper, we focus on an important part of MEMS gyro processing, i.e., predicting the future bias given calibration data with known (usually zero) input.We derive prediction algorithms based on Kalman filtering and the computation of moving averages, and compare their performance against simple averaging of the calibration data based on both simulations and real measured data. The results show that it is necessary to model fractional noise in order to consistently predict the bias of a modern MEMS gyro, but the complexity of the Kalman filter approach makes other methods, such as the moving averages, appealing.},

A self-sustaining process of near-wall turbulence structures is then discussed from the perspective of controlling this process for the purpose of skin-friction drag reduction. After recognizing that key parts of this self-sustaining process are linear, a linear systems approach to boundary-layer control is discussed. It is shown that singular-value decomposition analysis of the linear system allows us to examine different approaches to boundary-layer control without carrying out the expensive nonlinear simulations. Results from the linear analysis are consistent with those observed in full nonlinear simulations, thus demonstrating the validity of the linear analysis.

Near-wall turbulence is shown to decay without the linear coupling term. It is also shown that near-wall turbulence structures are not formed in their proper scales without the nonlinear terms in the Navier-Stokes equations, thus indicating that the formation of the commonly observed near-wall turbulence structures are essentially nonlinear, but the maintenance relies on the linear process.

This is the name given to the linear instability mechanism that tends to break up regions of elliptical streamlines in a rotating flow. The instability is discussed in the three different contextsan unbounded strained vortex, a localized strained vortex, and a triaxial ellipsoidwhere it was originally discovered and then rediscovered. These make it clear that the instability is one of parametric resonance where a normal mode, or pair of normal modes, of the undistorted rotating flow resonates with the underlying strain field. The effects of additional physics on the instability process are examined before its nonlinear evolution is discussed. Various applications of the instability in nature are then reviewed.},

It is based on a nonlinear exten- sion of nonmodal analysis and, in its simplest form, consists of finding the disturbance to the flow state of a given amplitude that experiences the largest energy growth at a certain time later. When coupled with a search over the disturbance amplitude, this can reveal the disturbance of least amplitude— called the minimal seed—for transition to another state such as turbulence. The approach bridges the theoretical gap between (linear) nonmodal theory and the (nonlinear) dynamical systems approach to fluid flows by allowing one to explore phase space at a finite distance from the reference flow state. Various ongoing and potential applications of the technique are discussed.},

abstract = {This article introduces and reviews recent work using a simple optimization technique for analysing the nonlinear stability of a state in a dynamical system. The technique can be used to identify the most efficient way to disturb a system such that it transits from one stable state to another. The key idea is introduced within the framework of a finite-dimensional set of ordinary differential equations (ODEs) and then illustrated for a very simple system of two ODEs which possesses bistability. Then the transition to turbulence problem in fluid mechanics is used to show how the technique can be formulated for a spatially-extended system described by a set of partial differential equations (the well-known Navier-Stokes equations). Within that context, the optimization technique bridges the gap between (linear) optimal perturbation theory and the (nonlinear) dynamical systems approach to fluid flows. The fact that the technique has now been recently shown to work in this very high dimensional setting augurs well for its utility in other physical systems. {\textcopyright} 2014 IOP Publishing Ltd.},

abstract = {The recent discovery of a new variational formulation for bounding turbulent flow quantities has rekindled interest in the whole field of producing rigorous inequality results directly from the Navier-Stokes equations initiated by Howard and Busse in the 1960s. The new Background method introduced by Doering and Constantin (1992, 1994, 1995, 1996) for bounding turbulent viscous dissipation appears to differ so fundamentally from that of Howard and Busse that any connection between the two methods has been fascinatingly unclear. Recently highly suggestive results obtained asymptotically (Kerswell, 1997) have indicated that the variational problems produced for both cases of shear flow and convection may be equivalent. Here we confirm this for the shear flow case by uncovering the common underlying functional which both approaches seek to make stationary. Busse's upper bound problem is found to be the optimal dual or complementary variational problem to that which emerges from the Doering-Constantin approach. This ensures that Busse's best bound exactly coincides with that available within the Doering-Constantin formalism for all Reynolds numbers. {\textcopyright} 1998 Elsevier Science B.V.},

Crucially, this new bound captures the correct scaling law of what is observed in rough pipes and demonstrates that while a smooth pipe is a singular limit of the Navier–Stokes equations (data suggest $\unicode[STIX]{x1D700}\sim 1/(\log Re)^{2}U^{3}/h$ as $Re\rightarrow \infty$ ), it is a regular limit for current bounding techniques. As an application, the bound is extended to oscillatory flow to estimate the energy dissipation rate for tidal flow across bottom topography in the oceans. },

Crucially, this new bound captures the correct scaling law of what is observed in rough pipes and demonstrates that while a smooth pipe is a singular limit of the Navier–Stokes equations (data suggest $\unicode[STIX]{x1D700}\sim 1/(\log Re)^{2}U^{3}/h$ as $Re\rightarrow \infty$ ), it is a regular limit for current bounding techniques. As an application, the bound is extended to oscillatory flow to estimate the energy dissipation rate for tidal flow across bottom topography in the oceans. },

abstract = {Abstract This is an introduction to the special issue titled "Networks of networks" that is in the making at Chaos, Solitons & Fractals. Recent research and reviews attest to the fact that networks of networks are the next frontier in network science [1-7]. Not only are interactions limited and thus inadequately described by well-mixed models, it is also a fact that the networks that should be an integral part of such models are often interconnected, thus making the processes that are unfolding on them interdependent. From the World economy and transportation systems to social media, it is clear that processes taking place in one network might significantly affect what is happening in many other networks. Within an interdependent system, each type of interaction has a certain relevance and meaning, so that treating all the links identically inevitably leads to information loss. Networks of networks, interdependent networks, or multilayer networks are therefore a much better and realistic description of such systems, and this Special Issue is devoted to their structure, dynamics and evolution, as well as to the study of emergent properties in multi-layered systems in general. Topics of interest include but are not limited to the spread of epidemics and information, percolation, diffusion, synchronization, collective behavior, and evolutionary games on networks of networks. Interdisciplinary work on all aspects of networks of networks, regardless of background and motivation, is very welcome.},

abstract = {Recent remarkable progress in computing power and numerical analysis is enabling us to fill a gap in the dynamical systems approach to turbulence. One of the significant advances in this respect has been the numerical discovery of simple invariant sets, such as nonlinear equilibria and periodic solutions, in well-resolved Navier--Stokes flows. This review describes some fundamental and practical aspects of dynamical systems theory for the investigation of turbulence, focusing on recently found invariant solutions and their significance for the dynamical and statistical characterization of low-Reynolds-number turbulent flows. It is shown that the near-wall regeneration cycle of coherent structures can be reproduced by such solutions. The typical similarity laws of turbulence, i.e. the Prandtl wall law and the Kolmogorov law for the viscous range, as well as the pattern and intensity of turbulence-driven secondary flow in a square duct can also be represented by these simple invariant solutions.},

abstract = {Characterizing and controlling nonlinear, multi-scale phenomena are central goals in science and engineering. Cluster-based reduced-order modeling (CROM) was introduced to exploit the underlying low-dimensional dynamics of complex systems. CROM builds a data-driven discretization of the Perron–Frobenius operator, resulting in a probabilistic model for ensembles of trajectories. A key advantage of CROM is that it embeds nonlinear dynamics in a linear framework, which enables the application of standard linear techniques to the nonlinear system. CROM is typically computed on high-dimensional data; however, access to and computations on this full-state data limit the online implementation of CROM for prediction and control. Here, we address this key challenge by identifying a small subset of critical measurements to learn an efficient CROM, referred to as sparsity-enabled CROM. In particular, we leverage compressive measurements to faithfully embed the cluster geometry and preserve the probabilistic dynamics. Further, we show how to identify fewer optimized sensor locations tailored to a specific problem that outperform random measurements. Both of these sparsity-enabled sensing strategies significantly reduce the burden of data acquisition and processing for low-latency in-time estimation and control. We illustrate this unsupervised learning approach on three different high-dimensional nonlinear dynamical systems from fluids with increasing complexity, with one application in flow control. Sparsity-enabled CROM is a critical facilitator for real-time implementation on high-dimensional systems where full-state information may be inaccessible.},

These quantities are related to underlying symmetries and they provide fundamental knowledge about physical laws, describe the evolution of the system, and enable system reduction. In this work, we formulate a data-driven architecture for discovering conserved quantities based on Koopman theory. The Koopman operator has emerged as a principled linear embedding of nonlinear dynamics, and its eigenfunctions establish intrinsic coordinates along which the dynamics behave linearly. Interestingly, eigenfunctions of the Koopman operator associated with vanishing eigenvalues correspond to conserved quantities of the underlying system. In this paper, we show that these invariants may be identified with data-driven regression and power series expansions, based on the infinitesimal generator of the Koopman operator. We further establish a connection between the Koopman framework, conserved quantities, and the Lie-Poisson bracket. This data-driven method for discovering conserved quantities is demonstrated on the three-dimensional rigid body equations, where we simultaneously discover the total energy and angular momentum and use these intrinsic coordinates to develop a model predictive controller to track a given reference value.},

abstract = {The data-driven discovery of dynamics via machine learning is currently pushing the frontiers of modeling and control efforts, and it provides a tremendous opportunity to extend the reach of model predictive control. However, many leading methods in machine learning, such as neural networks, require large volumes of training data, may not be interpretable, do not easily include known constraints and symmetries, and often do not generalize beyond the attractor where models are trained. These factors limit the use of these techniques for the online identification of a model in the low-data limit, for example following an abrupt change to the system dynamics. In this work, we extend the recent sparse identification of nonlinear dynamics (SINDY) modeling procedure to include the effects of actuation and demonstrate the ability of these models to enhance the performance of model predictive control (MPC), based on limited, noisy data. SINDY models are parsimonious, identifying the fewest terms in the model needed to explain the data, making them interpretable, generalizable, and reducing the burden of training data. We show that the resulting SINDY-MPC framework has higher performance, requires significantly less data, and is more computationally efficient and robust to noise than neural network models, making it viable for online training and execution in response to rapid changes to the system. SINDY-MPC also shows improved performance over linear data-driven models, although linear models may provide a stopgap until enough data is available for SINDY. SINDY-MPC is demonstrated on a variety of dynamical systems with different challenges, including the chaotic Lorenz system, a simple model for flight control of an F8 aircraft, and an HIV model incorporating drug treatment.},

In order to achieve a desirable tradeoff between the quality of approximation and the number of modes that are used to approximate the given fields, we develop a sparsity-promoting variant of the standard DMD algorithm. In our method, sparsity is induced by regularizing the least-squares deviation between the matrix of snapshots and the linear combination of DMD modes with an additional term that penalizes the $\ell_1$-norm of the vector of DMD amplitudes. The globally optimal solution of the resulting regularized convex optimization problem is computed using the alternating direction method of multipliers, an algorithm well-suited for large problems.

Up to second order in the perturbation parameter $\epsilon${lunate} we show that: (a) the H2 norm can be obtained from a conveniently coupled system of Lyapunov and Sylvester equations that are of the same dimension as A0; (b) there is no coupling between different harmonics of Ap (t) in the expression for the H2 norm. These two properties do not hold for arbitrary values of $\epsilon${lunate}, and their derivation would not be possible if we tried to determine the H2 norm directly without resorting to perturbation analysis. Our method is well suited for identification of the values of period T that lead to the largest increase/reduction of the H2 norm.

Spatially distributed and temporally varying body force fields are considered as inputs, and components of the resulting velocity fields are considered as outputs into these equations. We show how the roles of Tollmien-Schlichting (TS) waves, oblique waves, and streamwise vortices and streaks in subcritical transition can be explained as input-output resonances of the spatio-temporal frequency responses. On the one hand, we demonstrate the effectiveness of input field components, and on the other, the energy content of velocity perturbation components. We establish that wall-normal and spanwise forces have much stronger influence on the velocity field than streamwise force, and that the impact of these forces is most powerful on the streamwise velocity component. We show this using the relative scaling of the different input-output system components with the Reynolds number. We further demonstrate that for the streamwise constant perturbations, the spanwise force localized near the lower wall has, by far, the strongest effect on the evolution of the velocity field. {\textcopyright} 2005 Cambridge University Press.},

abstract = { This paper addresses the problem of designing low-order and linear robust feedback controllers that provide a priori guarantees with respect to stability and performance when applied to a fluid flow. This is challenging, since whilst many flows are governed by a set of nonlinear, partial differential–algebraic equations (the Navier–Stokes equations), the majority of established control system design assumes models of much greater simplicity, in that they are: firstly, linear; secondly, described by ordinary differential equations (ODEs); and thirdly, finite-dimensional. With this in mind, we present a set of techniques that enables the disparity between such models and the underlying flow system to be quantified in a fashion that informs the subsequent design of feedback flow controllers, specifically those based on the $\mathscr{H}_{\infty }$ loop-shaping approach. Highlights include the application of a model refinement technique as a means of obtaining low-order models with an associated bound that quantifies the closed-loop degradation incurred by using such finite-dimensional approximations of the underlying flow. In addition, we demonstrate how the influence of the nonlinearity of the flow can be attenuated by a linear feedback controller that employs high loop gain over a select frequency range, and offer an explanation for this in terms of Landahl's theory of sheared turbulence. To illustrate the application of these techniques, an $\mathscr{H}_{\infty }$ loop-shaping controller is designed and applied to the problem of reducing perturbation wall shear stress in plane channel flow. Direct numerical simulation (DNS) results demonstrate robust attenuation of the perturbation shear stresses across a wide range of Reynolds numbers with a single linear controller. },

abstract = {This article investigates the problem of obtaining a state-space model of the disturbance evolution that precedes turbulent flow across aerodynamic surfaces. This problem is challenging since the flow is governed by nonlinear, partial differential-algebraic equations for which there currently exists no efficient controller/estimator synthesis techniques. A sequence of model approximations is employed to yield a linear, low-order state-space model, to which standard tools of control theory can be applied. One of the novelties of this article is the application of an algorithm that converts a system of differential-algebraic equations into one of ordinary differential equations. This enables straightforward satisfaction of boundary conditions whilst dispensing with the need for parallel flow approximations and velocity-vorticity transformations. The efficacy of the model is demonstrated by the synthesis of a Kalman filter that clearly reconstructs the characteristic features of the flow, using only wall velocity gradient information obtained from a high-fidelity nonlinear simulation. {\textcopyright} 2011 Taylor & Francis.},

It is shown that a cycle exists which is local to the near-wall region and does not depend on the outer flow. It involves the formation of velocity streaks from the advection of the mean profile by streamwise vortices, and the generation of the vortices from the instability of the streaks. In- terrupting any of those processes leads to laminarization. The presence of the wall seems to be only necessary to maintain the mean shear. The generation of secondary vorticity at the wall is shown to be of little importance in turbulence generation under natural circumstances.

abstract = {The behaviour of the velocity and pressure fluctuations in the outer layers of wall-bounded turbulent flows is analysed by comparing a new simulation of the zero-pressure-gradient boundary layer with older simulations of channels. The 99 % boundary-layer thickness is used as a reasonable analogue of the channel half-width, but the two flows are found to be too different for the analogy to be complete. In agreement with previous results, it is found that the fluctuations of the transverse velocities and of the pressure are stronger in the boundary layer, and this is traced to the pressure fluctuations induced in the outer intermittent layer by the differences between the potential and rotational flow regions. The same effect is also shown to be responsible for the stronger wake component of the mean velocity profile in external flows, whose increased energy production is the ultimate reason for the stronger fluctuations. Contrary to some previous results by our group, and by others, the streamwise velocity fluctuations are also found to be higher in boundary layers, although the effect is weaker. Within the limitations of the non-parallel nature of the boundary layer, the wall-parallel scales of all the fluctuations are similar in both the flows, suggesting that the scale-selection mechanism resides just below the intermittent region, y/$\delta$ = 0.3-0.5. This is also the location of the largest differences in the intensities, although the limited Reynolds number of the boundary-layer simulation (Re≈ 2000) prevents firm conclusions on the scaling of this location. The statistics of the new boundary layer are available from http://torroja.dmt.upm.es/ftp/blayers/. {\textcopyright} 2010 Cambridge University Press.},

abstract = {The behaviour of the velocity and pressure fluctuations in the logarithmic and outer layers of turbulent flows is analysed using spectral information and probability density functions from channel simulations at Re$\tau$ ≥2000. Comparisons are made with experimental data at higher Reynolds numbers. It is found, in agreement with previous investigations, that the intensity profiles of the streamwise and spanwise velocity components have logarithmic ranges that are traced to the widening spectral range of scales as the wall is approached. The same is true for the pressure, both theoretically and observationally, but not for the normal velocity or for the tangential stress cospectrum, although even those two quantities have structures with lengths of the order of several hundred times the wall distance. Because the logarithmic range grows longer as the Reynolds number increases, variables which are 'attached' in this sense scale in the buffer layer in mixed units. These results give strong support to the attached-eddy scenario proposed by Townsend (1976), but they are not linked to any particular eddy model. The scaling of the outer modes is also examined. The intensity of the streamwise velocity at fixed y/h increases with the Reynolds number. This is traced to the large-scale modes, and to an increased intensity of the ejections but not of the sweeps. Several differences are found between the outer structures of different flows. The outer modes of the spanwise and wall-normal velocities in boundary layers are stronger than in internal flows, and their streamwise velocities penetrate closer to the wall. As a consequence, their logarithmic layers are thinner, and some of their logarithmic slopes are different.

abstract = {The relevance of Orr's inviscid mechanism to the transient amplification of disturbances in shear flows is explored in the context of bursting in the logarithmic layer of wall-bounded turbulence. The linearized problem for the wall normal velocity is first solved in the limit of small viscosity for a uniform shear and for a channel with turbulent-like profile, and compared with the quasiperiodic bursting of fully turbulent simulations in boxes designed to be minimal for the logarithmic layer. Many properties, such as time and length scales, energy fluxes between components, and inclination angles, agree well between the two systems. However, once advection by the mean flow is subtracted, the directly computed linear component of the turbulent acceleration is found to be a small part of the total. The temporal correlations of the different quantities in turbulent bursts imply that the classical model, in which the wall-normal velocities are generated by the breakdown of the streamwise-velocity streaks, is a better explanation than the purely autonomous growth of linearized bursts. It is argued that the best way to reconcile both lines of evidence is that the disturbances produced by the streak breakdown are amplified by an Orr-like transient process drawing energy directly from the mean shear, rather than from the velocity gradients of the nonlinear streak. This, for example, obviates the problem of why the cross-stream velocities do not decay once the streak has broken down. {\textcopyright} 2013 Author(s).All article content, except where otherwise noted, is licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution 3.0 Unported License.},

abstract = {The kinematics and dynamics of wall-bounded turbulence are surveyed, with emphasis on the multiscale processes associated with the logarithmic layer and with its interactions with the wall. It is shown that the logarithmic law reflects a momentum cascade and that its structure agrees reasonably well with Townsend's (1961) model of a self-similar family of attached eddies, each of which contains, on average, a sweep-ejection pair, a segment of a large velocity streak, and disorganized vorticity. Those logarithmic eddies are themselves turbulent objects and can be studied in minimal simulation boxes that are much larger than those in the buffer layer. It is argued that, near the wall, the logarithmic eddies are probably the same as the vortex packets identified by experiments, but that their dynamics does not appear to be especially linked to the buffer layer. Further from the wall, they align into longer superstreaks, although the mechanism remains unclear.},

Two parameters are important: the roughness Reynolds number k_s+ , which measures the effect of the roughness on the buffer layer, and the ratio of the boundary layer thickness to the roughness height, which determines whether a logarithmic layer survives. The behavior of transitionally rough surfaces with low k_s+ depends a lot on their geometry. Riblets and other drag-reducing cases belong to this regime. In flows with ±=k . 50, the effect of the roughness extends across the boundary layer, and is also variable. There is little left of the original wall-flow dynamics in these flows,\r\nwhich can perhaps be better described as flows over obstacles. We also review the evidence for the phenomenon of d-roughness. The theoretical arguments are sound, but the experimental evidence is inconclusive. Finally, we discuss some ideas on how rough walls can be modeled without the detailed computation of the flow around the roughness elements themselves.},

abstract = {{\textcopyright} 2017 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor  &  Francis Group. The phase-relationship between large-scale motions and small-scale fluctuations in a non-equilibrium turbulent boundary layer was investigated. A zero-pressure-gradient flat plate turbulent boundary layer was perturbed by a short array of two-dimensional roughness elements, both statically, and under dynamic actuation. Within the compound, dynamic perturbation, the forcing generated a synthetic very-large-scale motion (VLSM) within the flow. The flow was decomposed by phase-locking the flow measurements to the roughness forcing, and the phase-relationship between the synthetic VLSM and remaining fluctuating scales was explored by correlation techniques. The general relationship between large- and small-scale motions in the perturbed flow, without phase-locking, was also examined. The synthetic large scale cohered with smaller scales in the flow via a phase-relationship that is similar to that of natural large scales in an unperturbed flow, but with a much stronger organizing effect. Cospectral techniques were employed to describe the physical implications of the perturbation on the relative orientation of large- and small-scale structures in the flow. The correlation and cospectral techniques provide tools for designing more efficient control strategies that can indirectly control small-scale motions via the large scales.},

abstract = {The apparent amplitude modulation effect between large- and small-scale motions in the turbulent boundary layer, including both streamwise and wall-normal velocity components, is explored by cross-correlation techniques. Single-point hotwire and planar PIV measurements are employed to consider the envelopes of small-scale fluctuations in both directions and their correlation with the fluctuations of large-scale motions in the streamwise direction. The degree of correlation is interpreted as a measure of phase lag between the different scale motions, and these phase measurements are used to demonstrate that the fluctuations in the envelope of small-scale motions in both directions tend to lead corresponding fluctuations in the large scales in the streamwise direction. The cospectral density of the cross-correlation between the different scales is used to identify the particular large-scale motions dominant in the modulation effect, and it is shown that the dominant interacting (or 'modulating') scale corresponds in size to the very large-scale motions observed in internal flows but not normally observed in the outer region of the boundary layer. {\textcopyright} 2013 Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.},

abstract = {The zero-pressure-gradient turbulent boundary layer over a flat plate was perturbed by a temporally oscillating, spatial impulse of roughness, and the downstream response of the flow field was interrogated by hot-wire anemometry and particle-image velocimetry. The key features common to impulsively perturbed boundary layers, as identified in Jacobi  &  McKeon (J. Fluid Mech., 2011), were investigated, and the unique contributions of the dynamic perturbation were isolated by contrast with an appropriately matched static impulse of roughness. In addition, the dynamic perturbation was decomposed into separable large-scale and small-scale structural effects, which in turn were associated with the organized wave and roughness impulse aspects of the perturbation. A phase-locked velocity decomposition of the entire downstream flow field revealed strongly coherent modes of fluctuating velocity, with distinct mode shapes for the streamwise and wall-normal velocity components. Following the analysis of McKeon  &  Sharma (J. Fluid Mech., vol. 658, 2010, pp. 336-382), the roughness perturbation was treated as a forcing of the Navier-Stokes equation and a linearized analysis employing a modified Orr-Sommerfeld operator was performed. The experimentally ascertained wavespeed of the input disturbance was used to solve for the most amplified singular mode of the Orr-Sommerfeld resolvent. These calculated modes were then compared with the streamwise and wall-normal velocity fluctuations. The discrepancies between the calculated Orr-Sommerfeld resolvent modes and those experimentally observed by phase-locked averaging of the velocity field were postulated to result from the violation of the parallel flow assumption of Orr-Sommerfeld analysis, as well as certain non-equilibrium effects of the roughness. Additionally, some difficulties previously observed using a quasi-laminar eigenmode analysis were also observed under the resolvent approach; however, the resolvent analysis was shown to provide reasonably accurate predictions of velocity fluctuations for the forced Orr-Sommerfeld problem over a portion of the boundary layer, with potential applications to designing efficient flow control strategies. The combined experimental and analytical effort provides a new opportunity to examine the non-equilibrium and forcing effects in a dynamically perturbed flow. {\textcopyright} 2011 Cambridge University Press.},

The textbook starts with elementary known results, then progresses smoothly to advanced topics in current research.Many physical systems can be formulated using a Hamiltonian framework, leading to models described by ordinary or partial differential equations. For the purpose of control and for the interconnection of two or more Hamiltonian systems it is essential to take into account this interaction with the environment. This book is the first textbook on infinite-dimensional port-Hamiltonian systems. An abstract functional analytical approach is combined with the physical approach to Hamiltonian systems. This combined approach leads to easily verifiable conditions for well-posedness and stability.The book is accessible to graduate engineers and mathematicians with a minimal background in functional analysis. Moreover, the theory is illustrated by many worked-out examples.},

Although these MEMS sensors are relatively cheap, they give more inaccurate measurements than conventional high-quality gyroscopes and accelerometers. To be able to use these low-cost MEMS sensors with precision in all situations, a novel attitude estimation algorithm is proposed for fusing triaxial gyroscope and accelerometer measurements. An extended Kalman filter is implemented to estimate attitude in direction cosine matrix (DCM) formation and to calibrate gyroscope biases online. We use a variable measurement covariance for acceleration measurements to ensure robustness against temporary nongravitational accelerations, which usually induce errors when estimating attitude with ordinary algorithms. The proposed algorithm enables accurate gyroscope online calibration by using only a triaxial gyroscope and accelerometer. It outperforms comparable state-of-the-art algorithms in those cases when there are either biases in the gyroscope measurements or large temporary nongravitational accelerations present. A low-cost, temperature-based calibration method is also discussed for initially calibrating gyroscope and acceleration sensors. An open source implementation of the algorithm is also available.},

It is found that a large-scale motion in the log region becomes increasingly comparable in energy to the near-wall cycle as the Reynolds number increases. Through decomposition of fluctuating velocity signals, it is shown that this large-scale motion has a distinct modulating influence on the small-scale energy (akin to amplitude modulation). Reassessment of DNS data, in light of these results, shows similar trends, with the rate and intensity of production due to the near-wall cycle subject to a modulating influence from the largest-scale motions.},

abstract = {Careful reassessment of new and pre-existing data shows that recorded scatter in the hot-wire-measured near-wall peak in viscous-scaled streamwise turbulence intensity is due in large part to the simultaneous competing effects of the Reynolds number and viscous-scaled wire length l+. An empirical expression is given to account for these effects. These competing factors can explain much of the disparity in existing literature, in particular explaining how previous studies have incorrectly concluded that the inner-scaled near-wall peak is independent of the Reynolds number. We also investigate the appearance of the so-called outer peak in the broadband streamwise intensity, found by some researchers to occur within the log region of high-Reynolds-number boundary layers. We show that the is consistent with the attenuation of small scales due to large l+. For turbulent boundary layers, in the absence of spatial resolution problems, there is no outer peak up to the Reynolds numbers investigated here (Re and for internal geometries maximum flow frequency1 scaling. In doing so, we are able to rationalize much of the disparity in pre-existing literature over the kx&8722;1 region of self-similarity. Not surprisingly, the attenuated spectra also indicate that Kolmogorov-scaled spectra are subject to substantial errors due to wire spatial resolution issues. These errors persist to wavelengths far beyond those which we might otherwise assume from simple isotropic assumptions of small-scale motions. The effects of hot-wire length-to-diameter ratio (l/d) are also briefly investigated. For the moderate wire Reynolds numbers investigated here, reducing l/d from 200 to 100 has a detrimental effect on measured turbulent fluctuations at a wide range of energetic scales, affecting both the broadband intensity and the energy spectra.},

abstract = {The paper presents a nonlinear state-feedback control design approach for long-time average cost control, where the control effort is assumed to be expensive. The approach is based on sum-of-squares and semi-definite programming techniques. It is applicable to dynamical systems whose right-hand side is a polynomial function in the state variables and the controls. The key idea, first described but not implemented in (Chernyshenko et al., Phil. Trans. R. Soc. A, 372, 2014), is that the difficult problem of optimizing a cost function involving long-time averages is replaced by an optimization of the upper bound of the same average. As such, controller design requires the simultaneous optimization of both the control law and a tunable function, similar to a Lyapunov function. The present paper introduces a method resolving the well-known inherent non-convexity of this kind of optimization. The method is based on the formal assumption that the control is expensive, from which it follows that the optimal control is small. The resulting asymptotic optimization problems are convex. The derivation of all the polynomial coefficients in the controller is given in terms of the solvability conditions of state-dependent linear and bilinear inequalities. The proposed approach is applied to the problem of designing a full-information feedback controller that mitigates vortex shedding in the wake of a circular cylinder in the laminar regime via rotary oscillations. Control results on a reduced-order model of the actuated wake and in direct numerical simulation are reported.},

abstract = {The wall-bounded turbulent flows are populated by coherent motions with different scales. The inner motions (near-wall cycle) have been well recognized in wall turbulence. Since the last decade, it has also been reported that a distinct outer peak will emerge in the premultiplied spectra of streamwise velocity fluctuations in canonical-wall-flow configurations at high Reynolds numbers. It is an important energetic signature of the very-large-scale motions or the outer motions herein. However, at low to moderate Reynolds numbers, both the wall-normal locations and length scales of the inner and outer motions are very close to each other, imposing significant difficulties to separate them. Even more, we still do not know the critical Reynolds number for the emergence of the energetic outer motions. In the present study, we propose an assumption that the inner motions that are free of outer motions and transitional effects should be well scaled by wall units, for which we name "the turbulence with only inner motions" (TIM). By carrying out direct numerical simulation (DNS) at low Reynolds numbers, the critical Reynolds number is determined to be Re $\tau$ ≈ 110, where Re $\tau$ is the friction Reynolds number. Empirical fitting formulas for the broadband streamwise turbulence intensity and premultiplied spectra of TIM are proposed based on the DNS data. Furthermore, with publicly available DNS database of Reynolds number up to Re $\tau$ = 5200, the turbulence energy contributions by the outer motions are studied by subtracting that of TIM from the total. The result implies possibly distinct modulation effects on motions with different scales.},

abstract = {Budgets for the nonzero components of the Reynolds-stress tensor are presented for numerical channels with Reynolds numbers in the range Re$\tau$= 180-2000. The scaling of the different terms is discussed, both above and within the buffer and viscous layers. Above x2+≈ 150, most budget components scale reasonably well with u$\tau$3/h, but the scaling with u$\tau$4/h is generally poor below that level. That is especially true for the dissipations and for the pressure-related terms. The former is traced to the effect of the wall-parallel large-scale motions, and the latter to the scaling of the pressure itself. It is also found that the pressure terms scale better near the wall when they are not separated into their diffusion and deviatoric components, but mostly only because the two terms tend to cancel each other in the viscous sublayer. The budgets, together with their statistical uncertainties, are available electronically from http://torroja.dmt.upm.es/channels. {\textcopyright} 2008 American Institute of Physics.},

@article{Howland2018,
abstract = {In a turbulent flow, small- and large-scale fluid motions are coupled. In this work, we investigate the small-scale response to large-scale fluctuations in turbulent flows and discuss the implications on large eddy simulation (LES) wall modelling. The interscale interaction in wall-bounded flows was previously parameterized in the predictive inner–outer (PIO) model, where the amplitude of the small scales responds linearly to the large-scale fluctuations. While this assumed linearity is valid in the viscous sublayer, it is an insufficient approximation of the true interscale interaction in wall-normal distances within the buffer layer and above. Within these regions, a piecewise linear response function (piecewise with respect to large-scale fluctuations being positive or negative) appears to be more appropriate. In addition to proposing a new response function, we relate the amplitude modulation process to the Townsend attached eddy hypothesis. This connection allows us to make theoretical predictions on the model parameters within the PIO model. We use these parameters to apply the PIO model to wall-modelled LES. Further, we present empirical evidence of amplitude modulation in isotropic turbulence. The evidence suggests that the existence of nonlinear interscale interactions in the form of amplitude modulation does not rely on the presence of a non-penetrating boundary, but on the presence of a range of viscosity-dominated scales and a range of inertial-dominated scales.},

abstract = {The Liapunov method for establishing stability has been used in a variety of fluid and plasma problems. For nondissipative systems, this stability method is related to well-known energy principles. A development of the Liapunov method for Hamiltonian systems due to Arnold uses the energy plus other conserved quantities, together with second variations and convexity estimates, to establish stability. For Hamiltonian systems, a useful class of these conserved quantities consists of the Casimir functionals, which Poisson-commute with all functionals of the given dynamical variables. Such conserved quantities, when added to the energy, help to provide convexity estimates bounding the growth of perturbations. These estimates enable one to prove nonlinear stability, whereas the commonly used second variation or spectral arguments only prove linearized stability. When combined with recent advances in the Hamiltonian structure of fluid and plasma systems, this convexity method proves to be widely and easily applicable. This paper obtains new nonlinear stability criteria for equilibria for MHD, multifluid plasmas and the Maxwell-Vlasov equations in two and three dimensions. Related systems, such as multilayer quasigeostrophic flow, adiabatic flow and the Poisson-Vlasov equation are also treated. Other related systems, such as stratified flow and reduced magnetohydrodynamic equilibria are mentioned where appropriate, but are treated in detail in other publications. {\textcopyright} 1985.},

abstract = {In applications involving the model-based control of transitional wall-bounded flow systems, it is often desired to estimate the interior flow state based on a history of noisy measurements from an array of flush-mounted skin-friction and pressure sensors on the wall. This paper considers this estimation problem, using a Kalman filter based on the linearized Navier-Stokes equations and appropriate stochastic models for the relevant statistics of the initial conditions, sensor noise and external disturbances acting on the system. We show that a physically relevant parameterization of these statistics is key to obtaining well-resolved feedback kernels with appropriate spatial extent for all three types of flow measurement available on the wall. The effectiveness of the resulting Kalman and extended Kalman filters that implement this feedback is verified for both infinitesimal and finite-amplitude disturbances in direct numerical simulations of a perturbed laminar channel flow. The consideration of time-varying feedback kernels is shown to be particularly advantageous in accelerating the convergence of the estimator from unknown initial conditions. A companion paper (Part 2) considers the extension of such estimators to the case of fully developed turbulence. {\textcopyright} 2005 Cambridge University Press.},

abstract = {This paper describes a robust linear time-invariant output-feedback control strategy to reduce turbulent fluctuations, and therefore skin-friction drag, in wall-bounded turbulent fluid flows, that nonetheless gives performance guarantees in the nonlinear turbulent regime. The novel strategy is effective in reducing the supply of available energy to feed the turbulent fluctuations, expressed as reducing a bound on the supply rate to a quadratic storage function. The nonlinearity present in the equations that govern the dynamics of the flow is known to be passive and can be considered as a feedback forcing to the linearised dynamics (a Lur'e decomposition). Therefore, one is only required to control the linear dynamics in order to make the system close to passive. The ten most energy-producing spatial modes of a turbulent channel flow were identified. Passivity-based controllers were then generated to control these modes. The controllers require measurements of streamwise and spanwise wall-shear stress, and they actuate via wall transpiration. Nonlinear direct numerical simulations demonstrated that these controllers were capable of significantly reducing the turbulent energy and skin-friction drag of the flow.},

Experimental results demonstrate that it only needs ∼ 8 s to achieve mode-matching intelligently in the improved fuzzy control system. In addition, a mismatching error  < 0.32 Hz is achieved over the temperature range from -40 °C to 80 °C in the neural network real-time control system, which is improved by more than one order of magnitude compared with that of once-time control system. In addition, the temperature coefficient of the zero bias is also improved to be 0.5°/h/°C in the real-time mode-matching control system. Experimental results of phase margin, gain margin, and sensitivity margin indicate that the closed-loop system is stable and robust enough over the full temperature range. Moreover, the bandwidth and bias instability of the mode-matching gyroscope with closed-loop controlled sense mode are  > 85 Hz and  < 5°/h, respectively.},

abstract = {The dispersion of a passive scalar in a fluid through the combined action of advection and molecular diffusion is often described as a diffusive process, with an effective diffusivity that is enhanced compared to the molecular value. However, this description fails to capture the tails of the scalar concentration distribution in initial-value problems. To remedy this, we develop a large-deviation theory of scalar dispersion that provides an approximation to the scalar concentration valid at much larger distances away from the centre of mass, specifically distances that are $O(t)$ rather than $O(t^{1/2})$, where $t \gg 1$ is the time from the scalar release. The theory centres on the calculation of a rate function obtained by solving a one-parameter family of eigenvalue problems which we derive using two alternative approaches, one asymptotic, the other probabilistic. We emphasise the connection between large deviations and homogenisation: a perturbative solution of the eigenvalue problems reduces at leading order to the cell problem of homogenisation theory. We consider two classes of flows in some detail: shear flows and cellular flows. In both cases, large deviation generalises classical results on effective diffusivity and captures new phenomena relevant to the tails of the scalar distribution. These include approximately finite dispersion speeds arising at large P\'eclet number $\mathrm{Pe}$ (corresponding to small molecular diffusivity) and, for two-dimensional cellular flows, anisotropic dispersion. Explicit asymptotic results are obtained for shear flows in the limit of large $\mathrm{Pe}$. (A companion paper, Part II, is devoted to the large-$\mathrm{Pe}$ asymptotic treatment of cellular flows.) The predictions of large-deviation theory are compared with Monte Carlo simulations that estimate the tails of concentration accurately using importance sampling.},

abstract = {The objective of this study is to explore concepts for active control of turbulent boundary layers leading to skin-friction reduction using the direct numerical simulation technique. Significant drag reduction is achieved when the surface boundary condition is modified to suppress the dynamically significant coherent structures present in the wall region. The drag reduction is accompanied by significant reduction in the intensity of the wall-layer structures and reductions in the magnitude of Reynolds shear stress throughout the flow. The apparent outward shift of turbulence statistics in the controlled flows indicates a displaced virtual origin of the boundary layer and a thickened sublayer. Time sequences of the flow fields show that there are essentially two drag-reduction mechanisms. Firstly, within a short time after the control is applied, drag is reduced mainly by deterring the sweep motion without modifying the primary streamwise vortices above the wall. Consequently, the high-shear-rate regions on the wall are moved to the interior of the channel by the control schemes. Secondly, the active control changes the evolution of the wall vorticity layer by stabilizing and preventing lifting of the spanwise vorticity near the wall, which may suppress a source of new streamwise vortices above the wall.},

A recent result of Salwen is used to derive a biorthogonality relation between the solution of the linearized equation for the stream function and the solutions of the adjoint problem. For the case of temporal stability, the orthogonality relation obtained is equivalent to that of Schensted for bounded flows. For the spatial stability problem, it is shown that the continuous spectrum of the Orr-Sommerfeld equation contains four branches. The biorthogonality relation is used to derive the formal solution to the boundary-value problem of spatial stability.

We investigated possible fitness costs of hyperparasitism as influenced by host size. Our study was conducted with the facultative hyperparasitoid Pachycrepoideus dubius Ashmead (Hymenoptera: Pteromalidae), which parasitizes host species differing greatly in size. We compared some fitness traits (level of successful parasitism, development time, sex ratio and offspring size) of P. dubius developing on large secondary / primary (Delia radicum L. (Diptera: Anthomyiidae)/ Trybliographa rapae Westwood (Hymenoptera: Figitidae)) or small secondary / primary host species (Drosophila melanogaster L. / Asobara tabida Nees (Hymenoptera: Braconidae)). In no-choice and choice experiments, P. dubius was able to develop on different stages of T. rapae (L2 (endophagous), L4 (ectophagous), and pupae) but that it preferred to parasitize unparasitized D. radicum pupae over pupae parasitized by T. rapae. Furthermore, in P. dubius, hyperparasitism was associated with fitness costs (lower level of successful parasitism, smaller adult size) and these costs were greater on the smallest host complex. We hypothesize that the size of D. melanogaster pupae parasitized by A. tabida may be close to the suboptimal host size for P. dubius beneath which the costs of hyperparasitism make this strategy nonadaptive. Hyperparasitism in terms of trade-offs between host quality and abundance of competitors is discussed.},

For finite dimensional approximations of fluid systems, we show how one can exploit recently developed optimization methods based on sum-of-squares decomposition to construct a polynomial Lyapunov function. We then show how these methods can be extended to infinite dimensional NavierStokes systems using robust optimization techniques. Crucially, this extension requires only the solution of infinite-dimensional linear eigenvalue problems and finite-dimensional sum-of-squares optimization problems. We further show that subject to minor technical constraints, a general polynomial Lyapunov function is always guaranteed to provide better results than the classical energy methods in determining a lower-bound on the maximum Reynolds number for which a flow is globally stable, if the flow does remain globally stable for Reynolds numbers at least slightly beyond the energy stability limit. Such polynomial functions can be searched for efficiently using the SOS technique we propose. {\textcopyright} 2011 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

abstract = { The effect of streamwise-varying steady transpiration on turbulent pipe flow is examined using direct numerical simulation at fixed friction Reynolds number $\mathit{Re}_{{\it\tau}}=314$ . The streamwise momentum equation reveals three physical mechanisms caused by transpiration acting in the flow: modification of Reynolds shear stress, steady streaming and generation of non-zero mean streamwise gradients. The influence of these mechanisms has been examined by means of a parameter sweep involving transpiration amplitude and wavelength. The observed trends have permitted identification of wall transpiration configurations able to reduce or increase the overall flow rate $-36.1\,\%$ and $19.3\,\%$ , respectively. Energetics associated with these modifications are presented. A novel resolvent formulation has been developed to investigate the dynamics of pipe flows with a constant cross-section but with time-mean spatial periodicity induced by changes in boundary conditions. This formulation, based on a triple decomposition, paves the way for understanding turbulence in such flows using only the mean velocity profile. Resolvent analysis based on the time-mean flow and dynamic mode decomposition based on simulation data snapshots have both been used to obtain a description of the reorganization of the flow structures caused by the transpiration. We show that the pipe flows dynamics are dominated by a critical-layer mechanism and the waviness induced in the flow structures plays a role on the streamwise momentum balance by generating additional terms. },

abstract = {We describe methods for proving bounds on infinite-time averages in differential dynamical systems. The methods rely on the construction of nonnegative polynomials with certain properties, similarly to the way nonlinear stability can be proved using Lyapunov functions. Nonnegativity is enforced by requiring the polynomials to be sums of squares, a condition which is then formulated as a semidefinite program (SDP) that can be solved computationally. Although such computations are subject to numerical error, we demonstrate two ways to obtain rigorous results: using interval arithmetic to control the error of an approximate SDP solution, and finding exact analytical solutions to relatively small SDPs. Previous formulations are extended to allow for bounds depending analytically on parametric variables. These methods are illustrated using the Lorenz equations, a system with three state variables $(x,y,z)$ and three parameters $(\beta,\sigma,r)$. Bounds are reported for infinite-time averages of all eighteen moments $x^ly^mz^n$ up to quartic degree that are symmetric under $(x,y)\mapsto(-x,-y)$. These bounds apply to all solutions regardless of stability, including chaotic trajectories, periodic orbits, and equilibrium points. The analytical approach yields two novel bounds that are sharp: the mean of $z^3$ can be no larger than its value of $(r-1)^3$ at the nonzero equilibria, and the mean of $xy^3$ must be nonnegative. The interval arithmetic approach is applied at the standard chaotic parameters to bound eleven average moments that all appear to be maximized on the shortest periodic orbit. Our best upper bound on each such average exceeds its value on the maximizing orbit by less than 1%. Many bounds reported here are much tighter than would be possible without computer assistance.},

abstract = {A fundamental problem in the simulation and control of complex physical systems containing distributed-parameter components concerns finite-dimensional approximation. Numerical methods for partial differential equations (PDEs) usually assume the boundary conditions to be given, while more often than not the interaction of the distributed-parameter components with the other components takes place precisely via the boundary. On the other hand, finite-dimensional approximation methods for infinite-dimensional input-output systems (e.g., in semi-group format) are not easily relatable to numerical techniques for solving PDEs, and are mainly confined to linear PDEs. In this paper we take a new view on this problem by proposing a method for spatial discretization of boundary control systems based on a particular type of mixed finite elements, resulting in a finite-dimensional input-output system. The approach is based on formulating the distributed-parameter component as an infinite-dimensional port-Hamiltonian system, and exploiting the geometric structure of this representation for the choice of appropriate mixed finite elements. The spatially discretized system is again a port-Hamiltonian system, which can be treated as an approximating lumped-parameter physical system of the same type. In the current paper this program is carried out for the case of an ideal transmission line described by the telegrapher's equations, and for the two-dimensional wave equation. {\textcopyright} 2004 Elsevier Ltd.

abstract = {We study the input-output response of a streamwise constant projection of the Navier-Stokes equations for plane Couette flow, the so-called 2D/3C model. Study of a streamwise constant model is motivated by numerical and experimental observations that suggest the prevalence and importance of streamwise and quasi-streamwise elongated structures. Periodic spanwise/wall-normal (z-y) plane stream functions are used as input to develop a forced 2D/3C streamwise velocity field that is qualitatively similar to a fully turbulent spatial field of DNS data. The input-output response associated with the 2D/3C nonlinear coupling is used to estimate the energy optimal spanwise wavelength over a range of Reynolds numbers. The results of the input-output analysis agree with previous studies of the linearized Navier-Stokes equations. The optimal energy corresponds to minimal nonlinear coupling. On the other hand, the nature of the forced 2D/3C streamwise velocity field provides evidence that the nonlinear coupling in the 2D/3C model is responsible for creating the well known characteristic "S" shaped turbulent velocity profile. This indicates that there is an important tradeoff between energy amplification, which is primarily linear and the seemingly nonlinear momentum transfer mechanism that produces a turbulent-like mean profile.},

abstract = {Streamwise and quasi-streamwise elongated structures have been shown to play a significant role in turbulent shear flows. We model the mean behaviour of fully turbulent plane Couette flow using a streamwise constant projection of the Navier-Stokes equations. This results in a two-dimensional three-velocity-component (2D/3C) model. We first use a steady-state version of the model to demonstrate that its nonlinear coupling provides the mathematical mechanism that shapes the turbulent velocity profile. Simulations of the 2D/3C model under small-amplitude Gaussian forcing of the cross-stream components are compared to direct numerical simulation (DNS) data. The results indicate that a streamwise constant projection of the Navier-Stokes equations captures salient features of fully turbulent plane Couette flow at low Reynolds numbers. A systems-theoretic approach is used to demonstrate the presence of large input-output amplification through the forced 2D/3C model. It is this amplification coupled with the appropriate nonlinearity that enables the 2D/3C model to generate turbulent behaviour under the small-amplitude forcing employed in this study. {\textcopyright} 2010 Cambridge University Press.},

Datasets were obtained in the logarithmic layer and beyond. The vector fields in the log layer (z+=92 and 150) revealed signatures of vortex packets similar to those proposed by Adrian and co-workers in their PIV experiments. Groups of legs of hairpin vortices appeared to be coherently arranged in the streamwise direction. These regions also generated substantial Reynolds shear stress, sometimes as high as 40 times −uw. A feature extraction algorithm was developed to automate the identification and characterization of these packets of hairpin vortices. Identified patches contributed 28% to −uw while occupying only 4% of the total area at z+=92. At z+=150, these patches occupied 4.5% of the total area while contributing 25% to −uw. Beyond the log layer (z+=198 and 530), the spatial organization into packets is seen to break down.},

Time series of hot-wire data are decomposed into large- and small-scale components, and the impact of the large scale on the amplitude and frequency of the small scales is considered. The amplitude modulation effect is examined by conditionally averaging the small-scale intensity ( ${ u}_{S}^{2} $ ) for various values of the large-scale fluctuation ( ${u}_{L} $ ). It is shown that ${ u}_{S}^{2} $ increases with increasing value of ${u}_{L} $ in the near-wall region, whereas, farther away from the wall, ${ u}_{S}^{2} $ decreases with increasing ${u}_{L} $ . The rate of increase in small-scale intensity with the strength of the large-scale signal is neither symmetric (about ${u}_{L} = 0$ ) nor linear. The extent of the frequency modulation is examined by counting the number of occurrences of local maxima or minima in the small-scale signal. It is shown that the frequency modulation effect is confined to the near-wall region and its extent diminishes rapidly beyond ${y}^{+ } = 100$ . A phase lag between the large- and small-scale fluctuations, in terms of amplitude modulation, has also been identified, which is in agreement with previous studies. The phase lag between large- and small-scale fluctuations for frequency modulation is comparable to that of amplitude modulation in the near-wall region. The combined effect of both amplitude and frequency modulation is also examined by computing conditional spectra of the small-scale signal conditioned on the large scales.

abstract = {Hamilton's principle of stationary action lies at the foundation of theoretical physics and is applied in many other disciplines from pure mathematics to economics. Despite its utility, Hamilton's principle has a subtle pitfall that often goes unnoticed in physics: it is formulated as a boundary value problem in time but is used to derive equations of motion that are solved with initial data. This subtlety can have undesirable effects. I present a formulation of Hamilton's principle that is compatible with initial value problems. Remarkably, this leads to a natural formulation for the Lagrangian and Hamiltonian dynamics of generic non-conservative systems, thereby filling a long-standing gap in classical mechanics. Thus dissipative effects, for example, can be studied with new tools that may have application in a variety of disciplines. The new formalism is demonstrated by two examples of non-conservative systems: an object moving in a fluid with viscous drag forces and a harmonic oscillator coupled to a dissipative environment.},

Motion tracking based on commercial inertial measurements units (IMUs) has been widely studied in the latter years as it is a cost-effective enabling technology for those applications in which motion tracking based on optical technologies is unsuitable. This measurement method has a high impact in human performance assessment and human-robot interaction. IMU motion tracking systems are indeed self-contained and wearable, allowing for long-lasting tracking of the user motion in situated environments. After a survey on IMU-based human tracking, five techniques for motion reconstruction were selected and compared to reconstruct a human arm motion. IMU based estimation was matched against motion tracking based on the Vicon marker-based motion tracking system considered as ground truth. Results show that all but one of the selected models perform similarly (about 35 mm average position estimation error). {\textcopyright}2017 by the authors.},

abstract = {In order to reduce the computational complexity, and improve the pitch/roll estimation accuracy of the low-cost attitude heading reference system (AHRS) under conditions of magnetic-distortion, a novel linear Kalman filter, suitable for nonlinear attitude estimation, is proposed in this paper. The new algorithm is the combination of two-step geometrically-intuitive correction (TGIC) and the Kalman filter. In the proposed algorithm, the sequential two-step geometrically-intuitive correction scheme is used to make the current estimation of pitch/roll immune to magnetic distortion. Meanwhile, the TGIC produces a computed quaternion input for the Kalman filter, which avoids the linearization error of measurement equations and reduces the computational complexity. Several experiments have been carried out to validate the performance of the filter design. The results demonstrate that the mean time consumption and the root mean square error (RMSE) of pitch/roll estimation under magnetic disturbances are reduced by 45.9% and 33.8%, respectively, when compared with a standard filter. In addition, the proposed filter is applicable for attitude estimation under various dynamic conditions.},

abstract = {The no-slip boundary condition results in a velocity shear forming in fluid flow near a solid surface. This shear flow supports the turbulence characteristic of fluid flow near boundaries at Reynolds numbers above $\approx1000$ by making available to perturbations the kinetic energy of the externally forced flow. Understanding the physical mechanism underlying this energy transfer poses a fundamental question. Although qualitative understanding that this transfer involves nonlinear destabilization of the roll-streak coherent structure has been established, identification of this instability has resisted analysis. The reason this instability has resisted analysis is that its analytic expression lies in the Navier-Stokes equations (NS) expressed using statistical rather than state variables. Expressing NS as a statistical state dynamics (SSD) at second order in a cumulant expansion suffices to allow analytical identification of the nonlinear roll-streak instability underlying turbulence in wall-bounded shear flow. In this nonlinear instability the turbulent perturbation field is identified by the SSD with the Lyapunov vectors of the linear operator governing perturbation evolution about the time-dependent streamwise mean flow. In this work, the implications of the predictions of SSD analysis (that this parametric instability underlies the dynamics of turbulence in Couette flow and that the perturbation structures are the associated Lyapunov vectors) are interpreted to imply new conceptual approaches to controlling turbulence. It is shown that the perturbation component of turbulence is supported on the streamwise mean flow, which implies optimal control should be formulated to suppress perturbations from the streamwise mean. It is also shown that suppressing only the top few Lyapunov vectors on the streamwise mean vectors results in laminarization. These results are verified using DNS.},

abstract = {The perspective of statistical state dynamics (SSD) has recently been applied to the study of mechanisms underlying turbulence in a variety of physical systems. An SSD is a dynamical system that evolves a representation of the statistical state of the system. An example of an SSD is the second-order cumulant closure referred to as stochastic structural stability theory (S3T), which has provided insight into the dynamics of wall turbulence, and specifically the emergence and maintenance of the roll/streak structure. S3T comprises a coupled set of equations for the streamwise mean and perturbation covariance, in which nonlinear interactions among the perturbations has been removed, restricting nonlinearity in the dynamics to that of the mean equation and the interaction between the mean and perturbation covariance. In this work, this quasi-linear restriction of the dynamics is used to study the structure and dynamics of turbulence in plane Poiseuille flow at moderately high Reynolds numbers in a closely related dynamical system, referred to as the restricted nonlinear (RNL) system. Simulations using this RNL system reveal that the essential features of wall-turbulence dynamics are retained. Consistent with previous analyses based on the S3T version of SSD, the RNL system spontaneously limits the support of its turbulence to a small set of streamwise Fourier components, giving rise to a naturally minimal representation of its turbulence dynamics. Although greatly simplified, this RNL turbulence exhibits natural-looking structures and statistics, albeit with quantitative differences from those in direct numerical simulations (DNS) of the full equations. Surprisingly, even when further truncation of the perturbation support to a single streamwise component is imposed, the RNL system continues to self-sustain turbulence with qualitatively realistic structure and dynamic properties. RNL turbulence at the Reynolds numbers studied is dominated by the roll/streak structure in the buffer layer and similar very large-scale structure (VLSM) in the outer layer. In this work, diagnostics of the structure, spectrum and energetics of RNL and DNS turbulence are used to demonstrate that the roll/streak dynamics supporting the turbulence in the buffer and logarithmic layer is essentially similar in RNL and DNS.},

abstract = {This paper describes a study of the self-sustaining process in wall-turbulence based on a second order statistical state dynamics (SSD) model of Couette flow. SSD models with this form are referred to as S3T models and self-sustain turbulence with a mean flow and second order perturbation structure similar to that obtained by DNS. The use of a SSD model to study the physical mechanisms underlying turbulence has advantages over the traditional approach of studying the dynamics of individual realizations of turbulence. One advantage is that the analytical structure of SSD isolates and directly expresses the interaction between the coherent mean flow and the incoherent perturbation components of the turbulence. Isolation of the interaction between these components reveals how this interaction underlies both the maintenance of the turbulence variance by transfer of energy from the externally driven flow to the perturbation components as well as the enforcement of the observed statistical mean turbulent state by feedback regulation between the mean and perturbation fields. Another advantage of studying turbulence using SSD models is that the analytical structure of S3T turbulence can be completely characterized. For example, turbulence in the S3T system is maintained by a parametric growth mechanism. Furthermore, the equilibrium statistical state of the turbulence can be demonstrated to be enforced by feedback regulation in which transient growth of the incoherent perturbations episodically suppresses coherent streak growth preventing runaway parametric growth of the incoherent turbulent component. Using S3T to isolate these parametric growth and feedback regulation mechanisms allows a detailed characterization of the dynamics of the self-sustaining process in S3T turbulence with compelling implications for understanding the mechanism of wall-turbulence.},

abstract = {This paper reviews results from the study of wall-bounded turbulent flows using statistical state dynamics (SSD) that demonstrate the benefits of adopting this perspective for understanding turbulence in wall-bounded shear flows. The SSD approach used in this work employs a second-order closure which isolates the interaction between the streamwise mean and the equivalent of the perturbation covariance. This closure restricts nonlinearity in the SSD to that explicitly retained in the streamwise constant mean together with nonlinear interactions between the mean and the perturbation covariance. This dynamical restriction, in which explicit perturbation-perturbation nonlinearity is removed from the perturbation equation, results in a simplified dynamics referred to as the restricted nonlinear (RNL) dynamics. RNL systems in which an ensemble of a finite number of realizations of the perturbation equation share the same mean flow provide tractable approximations to the equivalently infinite ensemble RNL system. The infinite ensemble system, referred to as the S3T, introduces new analysis tools for studying turbulence. The RNL with a single ensemble member can be alternatively viewed as a realization of RNL dynamics. RNL systems provide computationally efficient means to approximate the SSD, producing self-sustaining turbulence exhibiting qualitative features similar to those observed in direct numerical simulations (DNS) despite its greatly simplified dynamics. Finally, we show that RNL turbulence can be supported by as few as a single streamwise varying component interacting with the streamwise constant mean flow and that judicious selection of this truncated support, or "band-limiting", can be used to improve quantitative accuracy of RNL turbulence. The results suggest that the SSD approach provides new analytical and computational tools allowing new insights into wall-turbulence.},

Examples of robust growth in model problems which support no instabilities and in baroclinic flows with realistic Ekman damping for which the exponential modes have zero or negative growth rates have been shown. Such examples have focused attention on the perturbations which are configured to tap the energy of mean flows. Here a critical examination of these favorably configured perturbations is given, making use of the simple constant free shear barotropic model which allows construction of exact two-dimensional isolated wave packet solutions.},

These data show the existence of two distinct wave number groups: a high wave number group that scales on the similarity variable k1$\xi$=$\omega$$\xi$/Uc($\xi$,$\omega$) associated with turbulent sources in the log region of the boundary layer, in which eddies decay in proportion to their size, and a low wave number group that defines the cutoff for the large‐scal...},

abstract = {We introduce a new technique to optimize a linear cost function subject to a one-dimensional affine homogeneous quadratic integral inequality, i.e., the requirement that a homogeneous quadratic integral functional, affine in the optimization variables, is non-negative over a space of functions defined by homogeneous boundary conditions. Such problems arise in stability analysis, input-to-state/output analysis, and control of many systems governed by partial differential equations (PDEs), in particular fluid dynamical systems. First, we derive outer approximations for the feasible set of a homogeneous quadratic integral inequality in terms of linear matrix inequalities (LMIs), and show that under mild assumptions a convergent, non-decreasing sequence of lower bounds for the optimal cost can be computed with a sequence of semidefinite programs (SDPs). Second, we obtain inner approximations in terms of LMIs and sum-of-squares constraints, so upper bounds for the optimal cost and strictly feasible points for the integral inequality can also be computed with SDPs. To aid the formulation and solution of our SDP relaxations, we implement our techniques in QUINOPT, an open-source add-on to YALMIP. We demonstrate our techniques by solving problems arising from the stability analysis of PDEs.},

abstract = {We describe methods for proving upper and lower bounds on infinite-time averages in deterministic dynamical systems and on stationary expectations in stochastic systems. The dynamics and the quantities to be bounded are assumed to be polynomial functions of the state variables. The methods are computer-assisted, using sum-of-squares polynomials to formulate sufficient conditions that can be checked by semidefinite programming. In the deterministic case, we seek tight bounds that apply to particular local attractors. An obstacle to proving such bounds is that they do not hold globally; they are generally violated by trajectories starting outside the local basin of attraction. We describe two closely related ways past this obstacle: one that requires knowing a subset of the basin of attraction, and another that considers the zero-noise limit of the corresponding stochastic system. The bounding methods are illustrated using the van der Pol oscillator. We bound deterministic averages on the attracting limit cycle above and below to within 1%, which requires a lower bound that does not hold for the unstable fixed point at the origin. We obtain similarly tight upper and lower bounds on stochastic expectations for a range of noise amplitudes. Limitations of our methods for certain types of deterministic systems are discussed, along with prospects for improvement.},

abstract = {We introduce an innovative numerical technique based on convex optimization to solve a range of infinite-dimensional variational problems arising from the application of the background method to fluid flows. In contrast to most existing schemes, we do not consider the Euler-Lagrange equations for the minimizer. Instead, we use series expansions to formulate a finite-dimensional semidefinite program (SDP) whose solution converges to that of the original variational problem. Our formulation accounts for the influence of all modes in the expansion, and the feasible set of the SDP corresponds to a subset of the feasible set of the original problem. Moreover, SDPs can be easily formulated when the fluid is subject to imposed boundary fluxes, which pose a challenge for the traditional methods. We apply this technique to compute rigorous and near-optimal upper bounds on the dissipation coefficient for flows driven by a surface stress. We improve previous analytical bounds by more than 10 times and show that the bounds become independent of the domain aspect ratio in the limit of vanishing viscosity. We also confirm that the dissipation properties of stress-driven flows are similar to those of flows subject to a body force localized in a narrow layer near the surface. Finally, we show that SDP relaxations are an efficient method to investigate the energy stability of laminar flows driven by a surface stress.},

However, challenges still exist in the field of sensor orientation estimation, where magnetic disturbance represents one of the obstacles limiting their practical application. The objective of this paper is to systematically analyze exactly how magnetic disturbances affects the attitude and heading estimation for a magnetic and inertial sensor. First, we reviewed four major components dealing with magnetic disturbance, namely decoupling attitude estimation from magnetic reading, gyro bias estimation, adaptive strategies of compensating magnetic disturbance and sensor fusion algorithms. We review and analyze the features of existing methods of each component. Second, to understand each component in magnetic disturbance rejection, four representative sensor fusion methods were implemented, including gradient descent algorithms, improved explicit complementary filter, dual-linear Kalman filter and extended Kalman filter. Finally, a new standardized testing procedure has been developed to objectively assess the performance of each method against magnetic disturbance. Based upon the testing results, the strength and weakness of the existing sensor fusion methods were easily examined, and suggestions were presented for selecting a proper sensor fusion algorithm or developing new sensor fusion method.},

The application of the methods of statistical mechanics to the description of the motion of fluid particles, i.e. to the Lagrangian dynamics, has led to a new quantitative theory of intermittency in turbulent transport. The first analytical description of anomalous scaling laws in turbulence has been obtained. The underlying physical mechanism reveals the role of statistical integrals of motion in non-equilibrium systems. For turbulent transport, the statistical conservation laws are hidden in the evolution of groups of fluid particles and arise from the competition between the expansion of a group and the change of its geometry. By breaking the scale-invariance symmetry, the statistically conserved quantities lead to the observed anomalous scaling of transported fields. Lagrangian methods also shed new light on some practical issues, such as mixing and turbulent magnetic dynamo.},

abstract = {Lars Onsager, a giant of twentieth-century science and the 1968 Nobel Laureate in Chemistry, made deep contributions to several areas of physics and chemistry. Perhaps less well known is his ground-breaking work and lifelong interest in the subject of hydrodynamic turbulence. He wrote two papers on the subject in the 1940s, one of them just a short abstract. Unbeknownst to Onsager, one of his major results was derived a few years earlier by A. N. Kolmogorov, but Onsager's work contains many gems and shows characteristic originality and deep understanding. His only full-length article on the subject in 1949 introduced two novel ideas—negative-temperature equilibria for two-dimensional ideal fluids and an energy-dissipation anomaly for singular Euler solutions—that stimulated much later work. However, a study of Onsager's letters to his peers around that time, as well as his private papers of that period and the early 1970s, shows that he had much more to say about the problem than he published. Remarkably, his private notes of the 1940s contain the essential elements of at least four major results that appeared decades later in the literature: 1 a mean-field Poisson-Boltzmann equation and other thermodynamic relations for point vortices; 2 a relation similar to Kolmogorov's 4/5 law connecting singularities and dissipation; 3 the modern physical picture of spatial intermittency of velocity increments, explaining anomalous scaling of the spectrum; and 4 a spectral turbulence closure quite similar to the modern eddy-damped quasinormal Markovian equations. This paper is a summary of Onsager's published and unpublished contributions to hydrodynamic turbulence and an account of their place in the field as the subject has evolved through the years. A discussion is also given of the historical context of the work, especially of Onsager's interactions with his contemporaries who were acknowledged experts in the subject at the time. Finally, a brief speculation is offered as to why Onsager may have chosen not to publish several of his significant results.},

abstract = {Turbulent stress is the fundamental quantity in the filtered equation for large-scale velocity that reflects its interactions with small-scale velocity modes. We develop an expansion of the turbulent stress tensor into a double series of contributions from different scales of motion and different orders of space derivatives of velocity, a multi-scale gradient (MSG) expansion. We compare our method with a somewhat similar expansion that is based instead on defiltering. Our MSG expansion is proved to converge to the exact stress, as a consequence of the locality of cascade both in scale and in space. Simple estimates show, however, that the convergence rate may be slow for the expansion in spatial gradients of very small scales. Therefore, we develop an approximate expansion, based upon an assumption that similar or 'coherent' contributions to turbulent stress are obtained from disjoint subgrid regions. This coherent-subregions approximation (CSA) yields an MSG expansion that can be proved to converge rapidly at all scales and is hopefully still reasonably accurate. As an important first application of our methods, we consider the cascades of energy and helicity in three-dimensional turbulence. To first order in velocity gradients, the stress has three contributions: a tensile stress along principal directions of strain, a contractile stress along vortex lines, and a shear stress proportional to 'skew-strain'. While vortex stretching plays the major role in energy cascade, there is a second, less scale-local contribution from 'skew-strain'. For helicity cascade the situation is reversed, and it arises scale-locally from 'skew-strain' while the stress along vortex lines gives a secondary, less scale-local contribution. These conclusions are illustrated with simple exact solutions of three-dimensional Euler equations. In the first, energy cascade occurs by Taylor's mechanism of stretching and spin-up of small-scale vortices owing to large-scale strain. In the second, helicity cascade occurs by 'twisting' of small-scale vortex filaments owing to a large-scale screw. 1. Introduction It is recognized that turbulent cascades are essentially multi-scale phenomena, and involve the coupling of modes at distinct scales. The property of locality implies that these interactions are mainly between adjacent scales (Eyink 2005). Of course, this locality is rather weak and modes at scales differing by an order of magnitude from a fixed scale can make a substantial contribution to transfer across that scale. In the filtering approach (Germano 1992), the nonlinear interaction between scales is embodied in the turbulent stress tensor $\tau$ that appears in the equation for the velocity u, low-pass filtered at length scale . This stress is the contribution to spatial transport of large-scale momentum generated by quadratic self-coupling of the subfilter scales.},

abstract = {We develop first-principles theory of kinetic plasma turbulence governed by the Vlasov-Maxwell-Landau equations in the limit of vanishing collision rates. Following an exact renormalization-group approach pioneered by Onsager, we demonstrate the existence of a "collisionless range" of scales (lengths and velocities) in 1-particle phase space where the ideal Vlasov-Maxwell equations are satisfied in a "coarse-grained sense". Entropy conservation may nevertheless be violated in that range by a "dissipative anomaly" due to nonlinear entropy cascade. We derive "4/5th-law" type expressions for the entropy flux, which allow us to characterize the singularities (structure-function scaling exponents) required for its non-vanishing. Conservation laws of mass, momentum and energy are not afflicted with anomalous transfers in the collisionless limit. In a subsequent limit of small gyroradii, however, anomalous contributions to inertial-range energy balance may appear due both to cascade of bulk energy and to turbulent redistribution of internal energy in phase space. In that same limit the "generalized Ohm's law" derived from the particle momentum balances reduces to an "ideal Ohm's law", but only in a coarse-grained sense that does not imply magnetic flux-freezing and that permits magnetic reconnection at all inertial-range scales. We compare our results with prior theory based on the gyrokinetic (high gyro-frequency) limit, with numerical simulations, and with spacecraft measurements of the solar wind and terrestrial magnetosphere.},

abstract = {The motion of spanwise vortical elements and large-scale bulges has been tracked in the outer region between wall-normal distance $z/ \delta = 0. 11$ and 0.30 of a turbulent boundary layer at ${\mathit{Re}}_{\theta } = 2460$. The experimental dataset of time-resolved three-dimensional velocity fields used has been obtained by tomographic particle image velocimetry. The tracking of these structures yields their respective average trajectories as well as the variations thereof, quantified by the root mean square of the trajectory coordinates as a function of time. It is demonstrated that the variation in convection can be described by a dispersion model for infinitesimal particles in homogeneous turbulence, which suggests that these vortical structures and bulges are transported passively by the external velocity field without significant changes in their topology, at least over the present observation time of $1. 2\delta / {U}_{e} $. However, this does not mean that the structure{\^{a}}s convection velocity is equal to the local flow velocity at each instant. Differences of the order of the Kolmogorov or wall friction velocity have been observed for the spanwise vortical elements. In addition, the simultaneous detection and tracking of multiple structures allows an evaluation of the relative velocity between two spanwise vortex elements, which are approximately aligned along the streamwise direction. The typical streamwise distance between such neighbouring structures is found to be around $0. 2\delta $. Their relative velocities are small, especially the streamwise component, which shows less variation as may be expected based on the relative flow velocity statistics for the same separation distance. This appears consistent with the hairpin packet model, which comprises a set of streamwise aligned hairpins travelling coherently. In exceptional cases, however, the structures approach each other rapidly, forcing an interaction on a time scale of the order of $1\delta / {U}_{e} $. It is shown that the measured variation in convection velocity can further be used successfully to predict the temporal development of space{\^{a}}time correlation functions starting from the instantaneous correlation map. In this prediction the structures are assumed to convect without change, following our observations.},

abstract = {The average rates of change in the invariants of the velocity gradient tensor (Q and R) have been determined experimentally in the outer layer of a turbulent boundary layer as a function of the invariants themselves. Subsequent integration yields trajectories in the QR plane describing the average evolution of the local flow topology following a fluid particle. The trajectories reveal inward spiraling orbits around and converging to the origin. The orbit's period is nearly constant at 14.3$\delta$/Ue corresponding to 470$\nu$/u$\tau$2, which may be regarded as the characteristic lifetime of the energy containing eddies in this part of the boundary layer. Furthermore, an empirical model for the average Q and R evolution is presented that reproduces the main features of the orbits in the vicinity of the origin. The deviation of the QR trajectories of individual fluid particles from the average trajectory is discussed in relation to the significant scatter observed in the rates of change in the invariants around their average.},

abstract = {A number of methods of reducing the drag over airfoils have been investigated. This paper considers the use of riblets, which are structures that run parallel to one another that are positioned longitudinally to the flow. It has been shown experimentally that when the shape, spacing and height of the riblets are optimized, the drag coefficient can be reduced by up to 10%. These results have been confirmed by direct numerical simulation studies. However, the mechanism of drag reduction is unclear. This paper examines the effect of riblet structures on the amplification of background noise within channel flow between two parallel plates (Poiseuille flow), where riblets are present on the surface of one of the plates. A linearized version of the Navier-Stokes equation about the steady flow is developed and through a coordinate transformation, the boundary conditions associated with the riblets are transferred into the partial differential equations. Spectral methods are used to discretize these equations, leading to a large-scale state space model. The energy amplification is calculated for the streamwise constant component of the flow from the controllability grammian and the associated Lyapunov equation is solved efficiently by exploiting the structure of the problem. Results of preliminary investigations show that introducing riblets into the flow reduces the amplification associated with the largest mode. {\textcopyright} 2011 IEEE.},

Using a nonlinear optimisation technique in a periodic computational domain, we identify the perturbations of plane Couette flow transitioning with least initial kinetic energy for Re ⩽ 3000. We suggest a new scaling law Ec = O(Re−2.7) for the energy threshold vs. the Reynolds number, in quantitative agreement with experimental estimates for pipe flow. The route to turbulence associated with such spatially localised perturbations is analysed in detail for Re = 1500. Several known mechanisms are found to occur one after the other: Orr mechanism, oblique wave interaction, lift-up, streak bending, streak breakdown, and spanwise spreading. The phenomenon of streak breakdown is analysed in terms of leading finite-time Lyapunov exponents of the associated edge trajectory. {\textcopyright} 2013 AIP Publishing LLC},

Additionally, with some simplified assumptions, we obtain two formulas for estimating the values of the mass/distance and velocity/speed of light ratios appropriate for a given post-Newtonian approximation. We show that the formulas derived in the present study, lead to a good numerical conservation of the Jacobi constant and allow for an approximate equivalence between the Lagrangian and Hamiltonian approaches at the same post-Newtonian order. Accordingly, the dynamics of the system is analyzed in terms of the Poincar\'e sections method and Lyapunov exponents, finding that for specific values of the Jacobi constant the dynamics can be either chaotic or regular. Our results suggest that the chaoticity of the post-Newtonian system is slightly in- creased in comparison with its Newtonian counterpart.},

abstract = {We give a localized regularity condition for energy conservation of weak solutions of the Euler equations on a domain $\Omega\subset \mathbb{R}^d$, $d\ge 2$, with boundary. In the bulk of fluid, we assume Besov regularity of the velocity $u\in L^3(0,T;B_{3}^{1/3, c_0})$. On an arbitrary thin neighborhood of the boundary, we assume boundedness of velocity and pressure and, at the boundary, we assume continuity of wall-normal velocity. We also prove two theorems which establish that the global viscous dissipation vanishes in the inviscid limit for Leray--Hopf solutions $u^\nu$ of the Navier-Stokes equations under the similar assumptions, but holding uniformly in a thin boundary layer of width $O(\nu^{\min\{1,\frac{1}{2(1-\sigma)}\}})$ when $u\in L^3(0, T; B_3^{\sigma, c_0})$ in the interior for any $\sigma\in [1/3,1]$. The first theorem assumes continuity of the velocity in the boundary layer whereas the second assumes a condition on the vanishing of energy dissipation within the layer. In both cases, strong $L^3_tL^3_{x,loc}$ convergence holds to a weak solution of the Euler equations. Finally, if a strong Euler solution exists in the background, we show that equicontinuity at the boundary within a $O(\nu)$ strip alone suffices to conclude the absence of anomalous dissipation.},

abstract = {Reducing wall drag in turbulent pipe and channel flows is an issue of great practical importance. In engineering applications, end-functionalized polymer chains are often employed as agents to reduce drag. These are polymers which are floating in the solvent and attach (either by adsorption or through irreversible chemical binding) at one of their chain ends to the substrate (wall). We propose a PDE model to study this setup in the simple setting where the solvent is a viscous incompressible Navier-Stokes fluid occupying the bulk of a smooth domain $\Omega\subset \mathbb{R}^d$, and the wall-grafted polymer is in the so-called mushroom regime (inter-polymer spacing on the order of the typical polymer length). The microscopic description of the polymer enters into the macroscopic description of the fluid motion through a dynamical boundary condition on the wall-tangential stress of the fluid, something akin to (but distinct from) a history-dependent slip-length. We establish global well-posedness of strong solutions in two-spatial dimensions and prove that the inviscid limit to the strong Euler solution holds with a rate. Moreover, the wall-friction factor $\langle f\rangle$ and the global energy dissipation $\langle \varepsilon\rangle$ vanish inversely proportional to the Reynolds number $Re$. This scaling corresponds to Poiseuille's law for the friction factor $\langle f\rangle \sim1/ Re$ for laminar flow and thereby quantifies drag reduction in our setting. These results are in stark contrast to those available for physical boundaries without polymer additives modeled by, e.g., no-slip conditions, where no such results are generally known even in two-dimensions.},

abstract = { An exact relation is derived between scalar dissipation due to molecular diffusivity and the randomness of stochastic Lagrangian trajectories for flows without bounding walls. This ‘Lagrangian fluctuation–dissipation relation' equates the scalar dissipation for either passive or active scalars to the variance of scalar inputs associated with initial scalar values and internal scalar sources, as these are sampled backward in time by the stochastic Lagrangian trajectories. As an important application, we reconsider the phenomenon of ‘Lagrangian spontaneous stochasticity' or persistent non-determinism of Lagrangian particle trajectories in the limit of vanishing viscosity and diffusivity. Previous work on the Kraichnan ( Phys. Fluids , 1968, vol. 11, pp. 945–953) model of turbulent scalar advection has shown that anomalous scalar dissipation is associated in that model with Lagrangian spontaneous stochasticity. There has been controversy, however, regarding the validity of this mechanism for scalars advected by an actual turbulent flow. We here completely resolve this controversy by exploiting the fluctuation–dissipation relation. For either a passive or an active scalar advected by any divergence-free velocity field, including solutions of the incompressible Navier–Stokes equation, and away from walls, we prove that anomalous scalar dissipation requires Lagrangian spontaneous stochasticity. For passive scalars, we prove furthermore that spontaneous stochasticity yields anomalous dissipation for suitable initial scalar fields, so that the two phenomena are there completely equivalent. These points are illustrated by numerical results from a database of homogeneous isotropic turbulence, which provide both additional support to the results and physical insight into the representation of diffusive effects by stochastic Lagrangian particle trajectories. },

abstract = {{\textcopyright} 2016 IEEE. In this paper we describe an IMU-based iterative controller for hip extension assistance where the onset timing of assistance is based on an estimate of the maximum hip flexion angle. The controller was implemented on a mono-articular soft exosuit coupled to a lab-based multi-joint actuation platform that enables rapid reconfiguration of different sensors and control strategy implementation. The controller design is motivated by a model of the suit-human interface and utilizes an iterative control methodology that includes gait detection and step-by-step actuator position profile generation to control the onset timing, peak timing, and peak magnitude of the delivered force. This controller was evaluated on eight subjects walking on a treadmill at a speed of 1.5 m/s while carrying a load of 23 kg. Results showed that assistance could be delivered reliably across subjects. Specifically, for a given profile, the average delivered force started concurrently with the timing of the maximum hip flexion angle and reached its peak timing 22.7 ± 0.63% later in the gait cycle (desired 23%) with a peak magnitude of 198.2 ± 1.6 N (desired 200 N), equivalent to an average peak torque of 30.5 ± 4.7 Nm. This control approach was used to assess the metabolic effect of four different assistive profiles. Metabolic reductions ranging from 5.7% to 8.5% were found when comparing the powered conditions with the unpowered condition. This work enables studies to assess the biomechanical and physiological responses to different assistive profiles to determine the optimal hip extension assistance during walking.},

abstract = {A new method is introduced for estimating the convection velocity\nof individual modes in turbulent shear flows that, in contrast to\nmost previous ones, only requires spectral information in the temporal\nor spatial direction over which a modal decomposition is desired,\nwhile only using local derivatives in other directions. If no spectral\ninformation is desired, the method provides a natural definition\nfor the average convection velocity, as well as a way to estimate\nthe accuracy of the frozen-turbulence approximation. Existing data\nfrom numerical turbulent channels at friction Reynolds numbers Re\n1900 are used to validate the new method against classical ones,\nand to characterize the dependence of the convection velocity on\nthe eddy wavelength and wall distance. The results indicate that\nthe small scales in turbulent channels travel at the local mean velocity,\nwhile large modes travel at a more uniform speed proportional to\nthe bulk velocity. To estimate the systematic deviations introduced\nin experimental spectra by the use of Taylor's approximation with\na wavelength-independent convection velocity, a semi-empirical fit\nto the computed convection velocities is provided. It represents\nwell the data throughout the Reynolds number range of the simulations.\nIt is shown that Taylor's approximation not only displaces the large\nscales near the wall to shorter apparent wavelengths but also modifies\nthe shape of the spectrum, giving rise to spurious peaks similar\nto those observed in some experiments.

abstract = {A numerical investigation of the mean wall shear stress properties on a spatially developing turbulent boundary layer over a smooth flat plate was carried out by means of a zonal detached eddy simulation (ZDES) technique for the Reynolds number range 3060?Re$\theta$ ?13 650. Some asymptotic trends of global parameters are suggested. Consistently with previous findings, the calculation confirms the occurrence of very large-scale motions approximately 5$\delta$ to 6$\delta$ long which are meandering with a lateral amplitude of 0.3$\delta$ and which maintain a footprint in the near-wall region. It is shown that these large scales carry a significant amount of Reynolds shear stress and their influence on the skin friction, denoted Cf ,2, is revisited through the FIK identity by Fukagata, Iwamoto & Kasagi (Phys. Fluids, vol. 14, 2002, p. L73). It is argued that Cf ,2 is the relevant parameter to characterize the high-Reynolds-number turbulent skin friction since the term describing the spatial heterogeneity of the boundary layer also characterizes the total shear stress variations across the boundary layer. The behaviour of the latter term seems to follow some remarkable self-similarity trends towards high Reynolds numbers. A spectral analysis of the weighted Reynolds stress with respect to the distance to the wall and to the wavelength is provided for the first time to our knowledge and allows us to analyse the influence of the largest scales on the skin friction. It is shown that structures with a streamwise wavelength $\lambda$x >$\delta$ contribute to more than 60% of Cf ,2, and that those larger than $\lambda$x>2$\delta$ still represent approximately 45% of Cf ,2.

abstract = {Abstract This report presents a novel orientation filter applicable to IMUs consisting of tri-axis gyroscopes and accelerometers, and MARG sensor arrays that also include tri-axis magnetometers. The MARG implementation incorporates magnetic distortion and gyroscope bias drift compensation. The filter uses a quaternion representation, allowing accelerometer and magnetometer data to be used in an analytically derived and optimised gradient-descent algorithm to compute the direction of the gyroscope measurement error as a quaternion derivative. The benefits of the filter include: (1) computationally inexpensive; requiring 109 (IMU) or 277 (MARG) scalar arithmetic operations each filter update, (2) effective at low sampling rates; e.g. 10 Hz, and (3) contains 1 (IMU) or 2 (MARG) adjustable parameters defined by observable system characteristics. Performance was evaluated empirically using a commercially available orientation sensor and reference measurements of orientation obtained using an optical measurement system. A simple calibration method is presented for the use of the optical measurement equipment in this application. Performance was also benchmarked against the propriety Kalman-based algorithm of orientation sensor. Results indicate the filter achieves levels of accuracy exceeding that of the Kalman-based algorithm; < 0.6◦ static RMS error, < 0.8◦ dynamic RMS error. The implications of the low computational load and ability to operate at low sampling rates open new opportunities for the use of IMU and MARG sensor arrays in real-time applications of limited power or processing resources or applications that demand extremely high sampling rates.},

abstract = { Spatial turbulence spectra for high-Reynolds-number shear flows are usually obtained by mapping experimental frequency spectra into wavenumber space using Taylor's hypothesis, but this is known to be less than ideal. In this paper, we propose a cross-spectral approach that allows us to determine the entire wavenumber–frequency spectrum using two-point measurements. The method uses cross-spectral phase differences between two points – equivalent to wave velocities – to reconstruct the wavenumber–frequency plane, which can then be integrated to obtain the spatial spectrum. We verify the technique on a particle image velocimetry (PIV) data set of a turbulent boundary layer. To show the potential influence of the different mappings, the transfer functions that we obtained from our PIV data are applied to hot-wire data at approximately the same Reynolds number. Comparison of the newly proposed technique with the classic approach based on Taylor's hypothesis shows that – as expected – Taylor's hypothesis holds for larger wavenumbers (small spatial scales), but there are significant differences for smaller wavenumbers (large spatial scales). In the range of Reynolds number examined in this study, double-peaked spectra in the outer region of a turbulent wall flow are thought to be the result of using Taylor's hypothesis.

@article{DeKat2013,
abstract = {This paper deals with determination of turbulent convection velocities from particle image velocimetry (PIV). Turbulent convection velocities are of interest because they can be used to map temporal information into space. Convection velocity can be defined in several different ways. One approach is to use the phase-spectrum of two signals with a time-separation. Obtaining convection velocity per wavenumber involves determining a spatial spectrum. PIV data is limited in spatial resolution and sample length. The influence of truncation of both spatial resolution and frequency resolution is investigated, as well as the influences of spatial filtering and measurement noise. These issues are investigated by using a synthetic data set obtained by creating velocity-time data with an imposed spectrum. Results from the validation show that, when applying a Hamming window before determining the phase spectrum, there is a usable range of wavenumbers for which convection velocities can be determined. Simulation of flow evolution, movement into and out of the measurement plane, and measurement noise show that these result in a spread in convection velocities using the current approach. Despite this spread, the most probable calculated convection velocity coincides with the imposed convection velocity. Application of the phase-spectral approach to a turbulent boundary layer with {$Re_\tau \approx 2700$}, shows there is a range of convection velocities and that the most probable convection velocity is equal to the local mean velocity.},

abstract = { Despite a growing body of recent evidence on the hierarchical organization of the self-similar energy-containing motions in the form of Townsend's attached eddies in wall-bounded turbulent flows, their role in turbulent skin-friction generation is currently not well understood. In this paper, the contribution of each of these self-similar energy-containing motions to turbulent skin friction is explored up to $Re_{\unicode[STIX]{x1D70F}}\simeq 4000$ . Three different approaches are employed to quantify the skin-friction generation by the motions, the spanwise length scale of which is smaller than a given cutoff wavelength: (i) FIK (Fukagata, Iwamoto, Kasagi) identity in combination with the spanwise wavenumber spectra of the Reynolds shear stress; (ii) confinement of the spanwise computational domain; (iii) artificial damping of the motions to be examined. The near-wall motions are found to continuously reduce their role in skin-friction generation on increasing the Reynolds number, consistent with the previous finding at low Reynolds numbers. The largest structures given in the form of very-large-scale and large-scale motions are also found to be of limited importance: due to a non-trivial scale interaction process, their complete removal yields only a 5–8 % skin-friction reduction at all of the Reynolds numbers considered, although they are found to be responsible for 20–30 % of total skin friction at $Re_{\unicode[STIX]{x1D70F}}\simeq 2000$ . Application of all the three approaches consistently reveals that the largest amount of skin friction is generated by the self-similar motions populating the logarithmic region. It is further shown that the contribution of these motions to turbulent skin friction gradually increases with the Reynolds number, and that these coherent structures are eventually responsible for most of turbulent skin-friction generation at sufficiently high Reynolds numbers. },

abstract = {The resolvent formulation of the Navier-Stokes equations gives a means for the char-acterisation and prediction of features of turbulent flows-such as statistics, structures and their nonlinear interactions-using the singular value decomposition of the resolvent operator based on the appropriate turbulent mean, following the framework developed by McKeon & Sharma (2010). This work will describe a methodology for approximating leading resolvent (i.e., pseudospectral) modes for shear-driven turbulent flows using prescribed analytic functions. We will demonstrate that these functions, which arise from the consideration of wavepacket pseudoeigenmodes of simplified linear operators (Trefethen 2005), in particular give an accurate approximation of the class of nominally wall-detached modes that are centred about the critical layer. Focussing in particular on modelling wall-normal vorticity modes, we present a series of simplifications to the governing equations that result in scalar differential operators that are amenable to such analysis. We validate our method on a model operator related to the Squire equation, and show for this simplified case how wavepacket pseudomodes relate to truncated asymptotic expansions of Airy functions. We demonstrate that the leading wall-normal vorticity response mode for the full Navier-Stokes equations may be accurately approximated by considering a second order scalar operator, equipped with a non-standard scalar inner product. Using this method, optimal mode shapes may be found by finding the appropriate root of a polynomial. In addition, the variation in mode shape as a function of wavenumber and Reynolds number may be captured by evolving a low dimensional differential equation in parameter space. This characterisation provides a theoretical framework for understanding the origin of observed structures, and allows for rapid estimation of dominant resolvent mode characteristics without the need for operator discretisation or large numerical computations. We explore regions of validity for this method, and in particular find that it remains accurate even when the modes have some amount of "attachment" to the wall. In particular, we demonstrate that the region of validity contains the regions in parameter space where large-scale and very-large-scale motions typically reside. We relate these findings to classical lift-up and Orr amplification mechanisms in shear-driven flows.},

abstract = {This paper provides a survey of modern nonlinear filtering methods for attitude estimation. Early applications relied mostly on the extended Kalman filter for attitude estimation. Since these applications, several new approaches have been developed that have proven to be superior to the extended Kalman filter. Several of these approaches maintain the basic structure of the extended Kalman filter, but employ various modifications in order to provide better convergence or improve other performance characteristics. Examples of such approaches include: filter QUEST, extended QUEST, the backwards-smoothing extended Kalman filter, and the interlaced extended Kalman filter. Filters that propagate and update a discrete set of sigma points rather than using linearized equations for the mean and covariance are also reviewed. A two-step approach is discussed with a first-step state that linearizes the measurement model and an iterative second step to recover the desired attitude states. These approaches are all based on the Gaussian assumption that the probability density function is adequately specified by its mean and covariance. Other approaches that do not require this assumption are reviewed, including particle filters and a Bayesian filter based on a non-Gaussian, finite-parameter probability density function on SO(3). Finally, the predictive filter, nonlinear observers and adaptive approaches are shown. The strengths and weaknesses of the various approaches are discussed.},

abstract = {The optimal energy growth of perturbations sustained by a zero pressure gradient turbulent boundary is computed using the eddy viscosity associated with the turbulent mean flow. It is found that even if all the considered turbulent mean profiles are linearly stable, they support transient energy growths. The most amplified perturbations are streamwise uniform and correspond to streamwise streaks originated by streamwise vortices. For sufficiently large Reynolds numbers two distinct peaks of the optimal growth exist, respectively scaling in inner and outer units. The optimal structures associated with the peak scaling in inner units correspond well with the most probable streaks and vortices observed in the buffer layer, and their moderate energy growth is independent of the Reynolds number. The energy growth associated with the peak scaling in outer units is larger than that of the inner peak and scales linearly with an effective turbulent Reynolds number formed with the maximum eddy viscosity and a modified Rotta–Clauser length based on the momentum thickness. The corresponding optimal perturbations consist of very large–scale structures with a spanwise wavelength of the order of $8\delta$. The associated optimal streaks scale in outer variables in the outer region and in wall units in the inner region of the boundary layer, in which they are proportional to the mean flow velocity. These outer streaks protrude far into the near wall region, having still 50\% of their maximum amplitude at $y^+0=20$. The amplification of very large–scale structures appears to be a robust feature of the turbulent boundary layer: optimal perturbations with spanwise wavelengths ranging from $4\delta$ to $15\delta$ can all reach 80\% of the overall optimal peak growth.},

abstract = {Stochastic Structural Stability Theory (S3T) provides analytical methods for understanding the emergence and equilibration of jets from the turbulence in planetary atmospheres based on the dynamics of the statistical mean state of the turbulence closed at second order. Predictions for formation and equilibration of turbulent jets made using S3T are critically compared with results of simulations made using the associated quasi-linear and nonlinear models. S3T predicts the observed bifurcation behavior associated with the emergence of jets, their equilibration and their breakdown as a function of parameters. Quantitative differences in bifurcation parameter values between predictions of S3T and results of nonlinear simulations are traced to modification of the eddy spectrum which results from two processes: nonlinear eddy-eddy interactions and formation of discrete non-zonal structures. Remarkably, these non-zonal structures, which substantially modify the turbulence spectrum, are found to arise from S3T instability. Formation as linear instabilities and equilibration at finite amplitude of multiple equilibria for identical parameter values in the form of jets with distinct meridional wavenumbers is verified as is the existence at equilibrium of finite amplitude non-zonal structures in the form of nonlinearly modified Rossby waves. When zonal jets and nonlinearly modified Rossby waves coexist at finite amplitude the jet structure is generally found to dominate even if it is linearly less unstable. The physical reality of the manifold of S3T jets and non-zonal structures is underscored by the existence in nonlinear simulations of jet structure at subcritical S3T parameter values which are identified with stable S3T jet modes excited by turbulent fluctuations.},

abstract = {The paper describes the energy fluxes simultaneously occurring in the space of scales and in the physical space of wall-turbulent flows. The unexpected behaviour of the energy fluxes consists of spiral-like paths in the combined physical/scale space where the controversial reverse energy cascade plays a central role. Two dynamical processes are identified as driving mechanisms for the fluxes, one in the near-wall region and a second one further away from the wall. The former, stronger, one is related to the dynamics involved in the near-wall turbulence regeneration cycle. The second suggests an outer self-sustaining mechanism which is asymptotically expected to take place in the eventual log layer and could explain the debated mixed inner/outer scaling of the near-wall statistics. The observed behaviour may have strong repercussions on both theoretical and modelling approaches to wall turbulence, as anticipated by a simple equation which is shown able to capture most of the rich dynamics of the shear-dominated region of the flow.},

@article{Cherubini2013,
abstract = {This paper provides the analysis of bursting and transition to turbulence in a Couette flow, based on the growth of nonlinear optimal disturbances. We use a global variational procedure to identify such optimal disturbances, defined as those initial perturbations yielding the largest energy growth at a given target time, for given Reynolds number and initial energy. The nonlinear optimal disturbances are found to be characterized by a basic structure, composed of inclined streamwise vortices along localized regions of low and high momentum. This basic structure closely recalls that found in boundary-layer flow (Cherubini et al., J. Fluid Mech., vol. 689, 2011, pp. 221-253), indicating that this structure may be considered the most 'energetic' one at short target times. However, small differences in the shape of these optimal perturbations, due to different levels of the initial energy or target time assigned in the optimization process, may produce remarkable differences in their evolution towards turbulence. In particular, direct numerical simulations have shown that optimal disturbances obtained for large initial energies and target times induce bursting events, whereas for lower values of these parameters the flow is directly attracted towards the turbulent state. For this reason, the optimal disturbances have been classified into two classes, the highly dissipative and the short-path perturbations. Both classes lead the flow to turbulence, skipping the phases of streak formation and secondary instability which are typical of the classical transition scenario for shear flows. The dynamics of this transition scenario exploits three main features of the nonlinear optimal disturbances: (i) the large initial value of the streamwise velocity component; (ii) the streamwise dependence of the disturbance; (iii) the presence of initial inclined streamwise vortices. The short-path perturbations are found to spend a considerable amount of time in the vicinity of the edge state (Schneider et al., Phys. Rev. E, vol. 78, 2008, 037301), whereas the highly dissipative optimal disturbances pass closer to the edge, but they are rapidly repelled away from it, leading the flow to high values of the dissipation rate. After this dissipation peak, the trajectories do not lead towards the turbulent attractor, but they spend some time in the vicinity of an unstable periodic orbit (UPO). This behaviour led us to conjecture that bursting events can be obtained not only as homoclinic orbits approaching the UPO, as recently found by van Veen  &  Kawahara (Phys. Rev. Lett., vol. 107, 2011, p. 114501), but also as heteroclinic orbits between the equilibrium solution on the edge and the UPO. {\textcopyright} 2013 Cambridge University Press.},

abstract = {{\textcopyright} 2015 Cambridge University Press. Transition to turbulence in shear flows is often subcritical, thus the dynamics of the flow strongly depends on the shape and amplitude of the perturbation of the laminar state. In the state space, initial perturbations which directly relaminarize are separated from those that go through a chaotic trajectory by a hypersurface having a very small number of unstable dimensions, known as the edge of chaos. Even for the simple case of plane Couette flow in a small domain, the edge of chaos is characterized by a fractal, folded structure. Thus, the problem of determining the threshold energy to trigger subcritical transition consists in finding the states on this complex hypersurface with minimal distance (in the energy norm) from the laminar state. In this work we have investigated the minimal-energy regions of the edge of chaos, by developing a minimization method looking for the minimal-energy perturbations capable of approaching the edge state (within a prescribed tolerance) in a finite target time T. For sufficiently small target times, the value of the minimal energy has been found to vary with T following a power law, whose best fit is given by E T-1.75. For large values of T, the minimal energy achieves a constant value which corresponds to the energy of the minimal seed, namely the perturbation of minimal energy asymptotically approaching the edge state (Rabin et{\^{A}} al., J. Fluid Mech., vol. 738, 2012, R1). For T\geqslant 40, all of the symmetries of the edge state are broken and the minimal perturbation appears to be localized in space with a basic structure composed of scattered patches of streamwise velocity with inclined streamwise vortices on their flanks. Finally, we have found that minimal perturbations originate in a small low-energy zone of the state space and follow very fast similar trajectories towards the edge state. Such trajectories are very different from those of linear optimal disturbances, which need much higher initial amplitudes to approach the edge state. The time evolution of these minimal perturbations represents the most efficient path to subcritical transition for Couette flow.},

In particular, a background flow can be found corresponding to the linear functional used in the direct method and vice versa. It is shown that any bound obtained with the background flow method can also be obtained by the direct method. The reverse is true subject to an additional constraint.

abstract = {The first part of this paper reviews the application of the sum-of-squares-of-polynomials technique to the problem of global stability of fluid flows. It describes the known approaches and the latest results, in particular, obtaining for a version of the rotating Couette flow a better stability range than the range given by the classic energy stability method. The second part of this paper describes new results and ideas, including a new method of obtaining bounds for time-averaged flow parameters illustrated with a model problem and a method of obtaining approximate bounds that are insensitive to unstable steady states and periodic orbits. It is proposed to use the bound on the energy dissipation rate as the cost functional in the design of flow control aimed at reducing turbulent drag. {\textcopyright} 2014 The Author(s) Published by the Royal Society.

abstract = {Taylors' frozen turbulence hypothesis suggests that all turbulent eddies are advected by the mean streamwise velocity, without changes in their properties. This hypothesis has been widely invoked to compute Reynolds averaging using temporal turbulence data measured at a single point in space. However, in the atmospheric surface layer, the exact relationship between convection velocity and wave number k has not been fully revealed since previous observations were limited by either their spatial resolution or by the sampling length. Using Distributed Temperature Sensing (DTS), acquiring turbulent temperature fluctuations at high temporal and spatial frequencies, we computed convection velocities across wave numbers using a phase spectrum method. We found that convection velocity decreases as k−1/3 at the higher wave numbers of the inertial subrange instead of being independent of wave number as suggested by Taylor's hypothesis. We further corroborated this result using large eddy simulations. Applying Taylor's hypothesis thus systematically underestimates turbulent spectrum in the inertial subrange. A correction is proposed for point-based eddy-covariance measurements, which can improve surface energy budget closure and estimates of CO2 fluxes.\r\n},

abstract = {The linearised complex Ginzburg–Landau equation is a model for the evolution of small fluid perturbations, such as in a bluff body wake. By implementing actuators and sen- sors and designing an H2 optimal controller, we control a supercritical, infinite-domain formulation of this system. We seek the optimal actuator and sensor placement that minimises the H2 norm of the controlled system, from flow disturbances to a cost on the perturbation and input magnitudes. We formulate the gradient of the H2 squared norm with respect to actuator and sensor placements, and iterate toward the optimal placement. When stochastic flow disturbances are present everywhere in the spatial domain, it is optimal to place the actuator just upstream of the origin and the sensor just downstream. With pairs of actuators and sensors, it is optimal to place each actuator slightly upstream of each corresponding sensor, and scatter the pairs throughout the spatial domain. When disturbances are only introduced upstream, the optimal placement shifts upstream as well. Global mode and Gramian analyses fail to predict the optimal placement; they produce H2 norms about five times higher than at the true optimum. The wavemaker region is a better guess for the optimal placement.},

Boundary layer parameters such as $\Pi$, H and the time scale ratio, $\Omega$, are then carefully examined for consistency among the various experiments and their dependence on Reynolds number. Based on the predictions of the classical theory for these parameters, several criteria are established to evaluate whether a data set can be classified as ' well-behaved ', i.e. representative of the desired ' canonical ' state. We find that, when carefully applied, the different criteria are very consistent between themselves and can effectively be used interchangeably. The analysis can furthermore help identify the causes for deviations from the desired TBL state and hence serve as a guide in the design of future experiments.},

We statistically analyse the decay in plane Couette flow, quantify the breaking of self-sustaining feedback loops and demonstrate the existence of a whole continuum of possible decay paths. Drawing parallels with low-dimensional models and monitoring the location of the edge relative to decaying trajectories, we provide evidence that the edge of chaos does not separate state space globally. It is instead wrapped around the turbulence generating structures and not an independent dynamical structure but part of the chaotic saddle. Thereby, decaying trajectories need not cross the edge, but circumnavigate it while unwrapping from the turbulent saddle.},

We identify several new integrable cases for arbitrary value of the exponent $q, q\in R$. The $q=1$ and $q=2$ cases are analyzed in detail and the results are generalized to arbitrary $q$. Our results show that many classical integrable nonlinear oscillators can be derived as sub-cases of our results and significantly enlarge the list of integrable equations that exist in the contemporary literature. To explore the above underlying results we use the recently introduced generalized extended Prelle-Singer procedure applicable to second order ODEs. As an added advantage of the method we not only identify integrable regimes but also construct integrating factors, integrals of motion and general solutions for the integrable cases, wherever possible, and bring out the mathematical structures associated with each of the integrable cases.},

abstract = { Here, we report the measurements of two-dimensional (2-D) spectra of the streamwise velocity ( $u$ ) in a high-Reynolds-number turbulent boundary layer. A novel experiment employing multiple hot-wire probes was carried out at friction Reynolds numbers ranging from 2400 to 26 000. Taylor's frozen turbulence hypothesis is used to convert temporal-spanwise information into a 2-D spatial spectrum which shows the contribution of streamwise ( $\unicode[STIX]{x1D706}_{x}$ ) and spanwise ( $\unicode[STIX]{x1D706}_{y}$ ) length scales to the streamwise variance at a given wall height ( $z$ ). At low Reynolds numbers, the shape of the 2-D spectra at a constant energy level shows $\unicode[STIX]{x1D706}_{y}/z\sim (\unicode[STIX]{x1D706}_{x}/z)^{1/2}$ behaviour at larger scales, which is in agreement with the existing literature at a matched Reynolds number obtained from direct numerical simulations. However, at high Reynolds numbers, it is observed that the square-root relationship tends towards a linear relationship ( $\unicode[STIX]{x1D706}_{y}\sim \unicode[STIX]{x1D706}_{x}$ ), as required for self-similarity and predicted by the attached eddy hypothesis. },

Some applications are: real-time motion capture system, gait analysis for rehabilitation purposes, biomedical applications, advanced robotic applications such as mobile robot localization and Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAV) attitude estimation. In all the mentioned applications the accuracy and the fast response are the most important requirements, thus the research is focused on the design and the implementation of highly accurate hardware systems and fast sensor data fusion algorithms, named Attitude and Heading Reference System (AHRS), aimed at estimating the orientation of a rigid body with respect to a reference frame. A large number of different solutions can be found in the literature, and an experimental comparison of the most popular is presented in this work. In particular, the algorithm based on the gradient descent method and the algorithm based on a nonlinear complementary filter are compared to a standard Extended Kalman Filter (EKF) with the aim to show that a general method can easily compete with ad-hoc solutions and even outperform them in particular conditions. In order to validate the estimation accuracy a Kuka robot is used to compute the ground truth. Moreover, in order to estimate the computational burden, the algorithms are implemented on an ARM-Cortex M4-based evaluation board.},

abstract = {Turbulent wall-bounded flows exhibit a wide range of regimes with significant interaction between scales. The fluid dynamics associated with single-phase channel flows is predominantly characterized by the Reynolds number. Meanwhile, vastly different behaviour exists in particle-laden channel flows, even at a fixed Reynolds number. Vertical turbulent channel flows seeded with a low concentration of inertial particles are known to exhibit segregation in the particle distribution without significant modification to the underlying turbulent kinetic energy (TKE). At moderate (but still low) concentrations, enhancement or attenuation of fluid-phase TKE results from increased dissipation and wakes past individual particles. Recent studies have shown that denser suspensions significantly alter the two-phase dynamics, where the majority of TKE is generated by interphase coupling (i.e.  drag) between the carrier gas and clusters of particles that fall near the channel wall. In the present study, a series of simulations of vertical particle-laden channel flows with increasing mass loading is conducted to analyse the transition from the dilute limit where classical mean-shear production is primarily responsible for generating fluid-phase TKE to high-mass-loading suspensions dominated by drag production. Eulerian–Lagrangian simulations are performed for a wide range of particle loadings at two values of the Stokes number, and the corresponding two-phase energy balances are reported to identify the mechanisms responsible for the observed transition.},

abstract = {The convection velocity of large and intermediate scale velocity fluctuations in a nominally two-dimensional planar mixing layerits dependence upon the length scale, is explored by carrying out particle image velocimetry (PIV) experiments. A "global" convection velocity, containing the convection of all the length scales present in the flow, is produced by examining the autocorrelation functions between velocity fluctuations in successive PIV records across the mixing layer. This "global" convection velocity is found to be similar to the mean flow, although fluctuations on the low speed side of the mixing layer on average convect at speeds greater than the mean and fluctuations on the high speed side of the mixing layer are observed to convect at speeds less than the mean. Scale specific convection velocity profiles are then produced by examining the phase difference between the spectral content specific to one wavenumber in streamwise velocity fluctuation traces in successive PIV records, offset by time $\tau$. Probability density functions (pdfs) are produced of this phase difference, which is subsequently converted into a convection displacementthese show that the convection of single length scale fluctuations exhibits a significant variance, particularly so for larger scale fluctuations and in the high speed side of the mixing layer. Convection velocity profiles are produced from these pdfs using both the mean convection distance and the modal convection distance. It is observed that the convection velocity is relatively insensitive to the length scale of the fluctuations considered, particularly when the mean convection distance is used. A slight sensitivity to length scale is, however, observed for convection velocities based on the modal convection distance. This dependence is primarily observed in the high speed side of the mixing layer, in which smaller length-scale fluctuations convect more quickly than larger length-scale fluctuations. It is also observed that the magnitude of the fluctuation itself affects the convection velocity with larger magnitude fluctuations convecting less rapidly than lower magnitude ones at the largest length scales investigated with this behaviour being reversed at more intermediate length scales. {\textcopyright} 2013 AIP Publishing LLC.},

abstract = {Wearable smart devices, such as smart watch, wristband are becoming increasingly popular recently. They generally integrate the MEMS-designed inertial sensors, including accelerometer, gyroscope and compass, which provide a convenient and inexpensive way to collect motion data of users. Such rich, continuous motion data provide great potential for remote healthcare and decease diagnosis. Information processing algorithms play the critical role in these approaches, which is to extract the motion signatures and to access different kinds of judgements. This paper reviews key algorithms in these areas. In particular, we focus on three kinds of applications: 1) gait analysis; 2) fall detection and 3) sleep monitoring. They are the most popular healthcare applications based on the inertial data. By categorizing and introducing the key algorithms, this paper tries to build a clear map of how the inertial data are processed; how the inertial signatures are defined, extracted, and utilized in different kinds of applications. This will provide a valuable guidance for users to understand the methodologies and to select proper algorithm for specific application purpose.},

abstract = {The ability to discover physical laws and governing equations from data is one of humankind's greatest intellectual achievements. A quantitative understanding of dynamic constraints and balances in nature has facilitated rapid development of knowledge and enabled advanced technological achievements, including aircraft, combustion engines, satellites, and electrical power. In this work, we combine sparsity-promoting techniques and machine learning with nonlinear dynamical systems to discover governing physical equations from measurement data. The only assumption about the structure of the model is that there are only a few important terms that govern the dynamics, so that the equations are sparse in the space of possible functions; this assumption holds for many physical systems. In particular, we use sparse regression to determine the fewest terms in the dynamic governing equations required to accurately represent the data. The resulting models are parsimonious, balancing model complexity with descriptive ability while avoiding overfitting. We demonstrate the algorithm on a wide range of problems, from simple canonical systems, including linear and nonlinear oscillators and the chaotic Lorenz system, to the fluid vortex shedding behind an obstacle. The fluid example illustrates the ability of this method to discover the underlying dynamics of a system that took experts in the community nearly 30 years to resolve. We also show that this method generalizes to parameterized, time-varying, or externally forced systems.},

Current and future applications have epic proportion: cars, trucks, trains, airplanes, wind turbines, medical devices, combustion, chemical reactors, just to name a few. Methods to adaptively adjust open-loop parameters are continually improving toward shorter response times. However, control design for in-time response is challenged by strong nonlinearity, high-dimensionality, and time-delays. Recent advances in the field of model identification and system reduction, coupled with advances in control theory (robust, adaptive, and nonlinear) are driving significant progress in adaptive and in-time closed-loop control of fluid turbulence. In this review, we provide an overview of critical theoretical developments, highlighted by compelling experimental success stories. We also point to challenging open problems and propose potentially disruptive technologies of machine learning and compressive sensing.},

abstract = {In this work, we explore finite-dimensional linear representations of nonlinear dynamical systems by restricting the Koopman operator to an invariant subspace. The Koopman operator is an infinite-dimensional linear operator that evolves observable functions of the state-space of a dynamical system [Koopman 1931, PNAS]. Dominant terms in the Koopman expansion are typically computed using dynamic mode decomposition (DMD). DMD uses linear measurements of the state variables, and it has recently been shown that this may be too restrictive for nonlinear systems [Williams et al. 2015, JNLS]. Choosing nonlinear observable functions to form an invariant subspace where it is possible to obtain linear models, especially those that are useful for control, is an open challenge. Here, we investigate the choice of observable functions for Koopman analysis that enable the use of optimal linear control techniques on nonlinear problems. First, to include a cost on the state of the system, as in linear quadratic regulator (LQR) control, it is helpful to include these states in the observable subspace, as in DMD. However, we find that this is only possible when there is a single isolated fixed point, as systems with multiple fixed points or more complicated attractors are not globally topologically conjugate to a finite-dimensional linear system, and cannot be represented by a finite-dimensional linear Koopman subspace that includes the state. We then present a data-driven strategy to identify relevant observable functions for Koopman analysis using a new algorithm to determine terms in a dynamical system by sparse regression of the data in a nonlinear function space [Brunton et al. 2015, arxiv]; we show how this algorithm is related to DMD. Finally, we demonstrate how to design optimal control laws for nonlinear systems using techniques from linear optimal control on Koopman invariant subspaces.},

In this review, we first present the original derivation and early studies and then discuss the non-modal growth of streaks, the result of the lift-up process, in transitional and turbulent shear flows. In the second part, the effects on the lift-up process of additives in the fluid and of a second phase are discussed and new results presented with emphasis on particle-laden shear flows. For all cases considered, we see the lift-up process to be a very robust process, always present as a first step in subcritical transition.},

Although the Blasius function is unbounded, we nevertheless derive an expansion in rational Chebyshev functions TL j  which converges exponentially fast with the truncation, and tabulate enough coefficients to compute f and its derivatives to about nine decimal places for all positive real x. The power series of f has a finite radius of convergence, but the Euler-accelerated expansion is apparently convergent for all real x. We show that the singularities, which are first order poles to lowest order, have an infinite series of cosine-of-a-logarithm corrections. Lastly, we chart the behavior of f in the complex plane and conjecture that all singularities lie within three narrow sectors. {\textcopyright} A K Panders, Ltd.},

abstract = {Several missions have utilised halo orbits around the L1 and L2 Lagrange points of the Earth-Sun system. Due to the instability of these orbits, station-keeping techniques are required to prevent escape after orbit insertion. This paper considers using solar sail propulsion to provide station-keeping at quasi-periodic orbits around L1 and L2. Stable manifolds will be identified which provide near-Earth insertion to a quasi-periodic trajectory around the libration point. The possible control techniques investigated include solar sail area variation and solar sail pitch and yaw angle variation. Hill's equations are used to model the dynamics of the problem and optimal control laws are developed to minimise the control requirements. The constant thrust available using solar sails can be used to generate artificial libration points Sunwards of L1 or Earthwards of L2. A possible mission to position a science payload Sunward of L1 will be investigated. After insertion to a halo orbit at L1, gradual solar sail deployment can be performed to spiral Sunwards along the Sun-Earth axis. Insertion $\Delta$ V requirements and area variation control requirements will be examined. This mission could provide advance warning of Earthbound coronal mass ejections (CMEs) responsible for magnetic storms. {\textcopyright} 2007 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

Basic fluid equations are the main ingredient in the development of theories of Rayleigh-Taylor buoyancy-induced instability. Turbulence arises in the late stage of the instability evolution as a result of the proliferation of active scales of motion. Fluctuations are maintained by the unceasing conversion of potential energy into kinetic energy. Although the dynamics of turbulent fluctuations is ruled by the same equations controlling the Rayleigh-Taylor instability, here only phenomenological theories are currently available. The present review provides an overview of the most relevant (and often contrasting) theoretical approaches to Rayleigh-Taylor turbulence together with numerical and experimental evidence for their support. Although the focus is mainly on the classical Boussinesq Rayleigh-Taylor turbulence of miscible fluids, the review extends to other fluid systems with viscoelastic behavior, affected by rotation of the reference frame, and, finally, in the presence of reactions.},

abstract = {Coupled biological and chemical systems, neural networks, social interacting species, the Internet and the World Wide Web, are only a few examples of systems composed by a large number of highly interconnected dynamical units. The first approach to capture the global properties of such systems is to model them as graphs whose nodes represent the dynamical units, and whose links stand for the interactions between them. On the one hand, scientists have to cope with structural issues, such as characterizing the topology of a complex wiring architecture, revealing the unifying principles that are at the basis of real networks, and developing models to mimic the growth of a network and reproduce its structural properties. On the other hand, many relevant questions arise when studying complex networks' dynamics, such as learning how a large ensemble of dynamical systems that interact through a complex wiring topology can behave collectively. We review the major concepts and results recently achieved in the study of the structure and dynamics of complex networks, and summarize the relevant applications of these ideas in many different disciplines, ranging from nonlinear science to biology, from statistical mechanics to medicine and engineering. {\textcopyright} 2005 Elsevier B.V.

abstract = {Dissipation can be represented in Hamiltonian mechanics in an extended phase space as a symplectic process. The method uses an auxiliary variable which represents the excitation of unresolved dynamics and a Hamiltonian for the interaction between the resolved dynamics and the auxiliary variable. This method is applied to viscous dissipation (including hyper-viscosity) in a two-dimensional fluid, for which the dynamics is non-canonical. We derive a metriplectic representation and suggest a measure for the entropy of the system.},

abstract = {The problems of exact state reconstruction and approximate state estimation based on wall information in a wall-bounded incompressible unsteady flow are addressed. It is shown that, if in an arbitrarily small neighborhood of time t precise measurements are made of the two components of wall skin friction and the wall pressure, all terms in the Taylor-series expansions of the unsteady flow state near the wall at time t may be determined (in the linear setting, this determination may be made based on skin-friction measurements alone). Combining this fact with the analyticity of solutions of the nonlinear Navier-Stokes equation and the unique continuation theorem for analytic functions, in theory complete reconstruction of a fully-developed turbulent flow in a channel at any Reynolds number at time t is possible given only information about the unsteady flow available at the wall in a neighborhood of time t, without knowledge of the initial conditions of the flow. Thus, skin-friction and pressure measurements on the wall in a neighborhood of time t provide a unique "footprint" of the entire unsteady turbulent flow state; no other flow can have the same footprint. Indeed, higher-order terms are shown to uniformly improve the correlation of truncated Taylor-series expansions with the DNS of a turbulent flow near the wall. However, such series extrapolations amplify measurement noise, as they require differentiation in both space and time of the measurements, and the radius of convergence of the Taylor series expansions is less than 10 wall units. The so-called linear stochastic estimation technique, in which the polynomials forming the basis of the series expansion are replaced by well-behaved functions (such as POD modes) on the entire flow domain also demonstrates very poor convergence. In light of these limitations on direct extrapolations from measurements in the practical setting, an adjoint-based algorithm is presented and numerically tested for estimating the state of an entire turbulent channel-flow system based on a time history of noisy measurements at the wall. This algorithm effectively uses the unsteady nonlinear Navier-Stokes equation itself as a filter to find the flow solution that is most consistent with the available measurements.

abstract = {Optimal and robust control theories are used to determine effective, estimator-based feedback control rules for laminar plane channel flows that effectively stabilize linearly unstable flow perturbations at Re = 10 000 and linearly stable flow perturbations, characterized by mechanisms for very large disturbance amplification, at Re = 5000. Wall transpiration (unsteady blowing/suction) with zero net mass flux is used as the control, and the flow measurement is derived from the wall skin friction. The control objective, beyond simply stabilizing any unstable eigenvalues (which is relatively easy to accomplish), is to minimize the energy of the flow perturbations created by external disturbance forcing. This is important because, when mechanisms for large disturbance amplification are present, small-amplitude external disturbance forcing may excite flow perturbations with sufficiently large amplitude to induce nonlinear flow instability. The control algorithms used in the present work account for system disturbances and measurement noise in a rigorous fashion by application of modern linear control techniques to the discretized linear stability problem. The disturbances are accounted for both as uncorrelated white Gaussian processes (H2 or ‘optimal' control) and as fi- nite ‘worst case' inputs which are maximally detrimental to the control objective (H∞ or ‘robust' control). Root loci and transient energy growth analyses are shown to be inadequate measures to characterize overall system performance. Instead, appropri- ately defined transfer function norms are used to characterize all systems considered in a consistent and relevant manner. In order to make a parametric study tractable in this high-dimensional system, a convenient new scaling to the estimation problem is introduced such that three scalar parameters {$\gamma$, $\alpha$, } may be individually adjusted to achieve desired closed-loop characteristics of the resulting systems. These scalar parameters may be intuitively explained, and are defined such that the resulting con- trol equations retain the natural dual structure between the control parameter, , and the estimation parameter, $\alpha$. The performance of the present systems with respect to these parameters is thoroughly investigated, and comparisons are made to simple proportional schemes where appropriate. 305},

abstract = { Cauchy invariants are now viewed as a powerful tool for investigating the Lagrangian structure of three-dimensional (3D) ideal flow (Frisch & Zheligovsky, Commun. Math. Phys. , vol. 326, 2014, pp. 499–505; Podvigina et al. , J. Comput. Phys. , vol. 306, 2016, pp. 320–342). Looking at such invariants with the modern tools of differential geometry and of geodesic flow on the space SDiff of volume-preserving transformations (Arnold, Ann. Inst. Fourier , vol. 16, 1966, pp. 319–361), all manners of generalisations are here derived. The Cauchy invariants equation and the Cauchy formula, relating the vorticity and the Jacobian of the Lagrangian map, are shown to be two expressions of this Lie-advection invariance, which are duals of each other (specifically, Hodge dual). Actually, this is shown to be an instance of a general result which holds for flow both in flat (Euclidean) space and in a curved Riemannian space: any Lie-advection invariant $p$ -form which is exact (i.e. is a differential of a $(p-1)$ -form) has an associated Cauchy invariants equation and a Cauchy formula. This constitutes a new fundamental result in linear transport theory, providing a Lagrangian formulation of Lie advection for some classes of differential forms. The result has a broad applicability: examples include the magnetohydrodynamics (MHD) equations and various extensions thereof, discussed by Lingam et al. ( Phys. Lett.  A, vol. 380, 2016, pp. 2400–2406), and include also the equations of Tao (2016, arXiv:1606.08481  [math.AP]), Euler equations with modified Biot–Savart law, displaying finite-time blow-up. Our main result is also used for new derivations, and several new results, concerning local helicity-type invariants for fluids and MHD flow in flat or curved spaces of arbitrary dimension. },

Our basic technical tools are explicit analytical calculations of the traces of solutions of operator Lyapunov equations, which yield the covariance operators of the forced random velocity fields. The dependence of these quantities on both the Reynolds number and the spanwise wave number are explicitly computed. We show how the amplification mechanism is due to a coupling between wall-normal velocity and vorticity disturbances, which in turn is due to nonzero mean shear and disturbance spanwise variation. This mechanism is viewed as a consequence of the non-normality of the dynamical operator, and not necessarily due to the existence of near resonances or modes with algebraic growth.},

The operator defines how observables evolve in time along a nonlinear flow trajectory. In this paper, we perform a Koopman analysis of the first Hopf bifurcation of the flow past a circular cylinder. First, we decompose the flow into a sequence of Koopman modes, where each mode evolves in time with one single frequency/growth rate and amplitude/phase, corresponding to the complex eigenvalues and eigenfunctions of the Koopman operator, respectively. The analytical construction of these modes shows how the amplitudes and phases of nonlinear global modes oscillating with the vortex shedding frequency or its harmonics evolve as the flow develops and later sustains self-excited oscillations. Second, we compute the dynamic modes using the dynamic mode decomposition (DMD) algorithm, which fits a linear combination of exponential terms to a sequence of snapshots spaced equally in time. It is shown that under certain conditions the DMD algorithm approximates Koopman modes, and hence provides a viable method to decompose the flow into saturated and transient oscillatory modes. Finally, the relevance of the analysis to frequency selection, global modes and shift modes is discussed.},

abstract = {In Part 1, the scaling of the streamwise velocity energy spectra in turbulent boundary layers was considered. A spectral decomposition analysis provided a means to separate out attached and non-attached eddy contributions and was used to generate three spectral sub-components, one of which is a close representation of the spectral signature induced by self-similar, wall-attached turbulence. Since sub-components of the streamwise turbulence intensity $\overline{u^2}$ follow directly from the integrated components of the velocity energy spectra, we here focus on the scaling of the former. Specific attention is given to the potential $k_x^{-1}$ behaviour in spectra, at ultra-high $Re_\tau$, and its relation with the turbulence intensity adhering to a wall-normal logarithmic decay per Townsend's attached-eddy hypothesis. This decay with a Townsend--Perry constant of $A_1 = 0.98$ is suggested to be universal across all Reynolds numbers considered. It is also demonstrated how the logarithmic-region results are consistent with the Reynolds-number increase of the streamwise turbulence intensity in the near-wall region.},

abstract = {{\textcopyright} 2014 Springer Science+Business Media Dordrecht. Turbulent convection velocities in a turbulent boundary layer at a Reynolds number of R e = 2250 are examined via the use of a high repetition rate particle image velocimetry measurement undertaken in a water tunnel. Multiple cameras are used to improve the spatial dynamic range of the measurement and reduce the bias towards large-scale structures while simultaneously capturing a wall-normal domain of 0.06$\delta$ to 1.7$\delta$. The impact of measurement noise is minimized via careful temporal and spatial filtering of the velocity fields as guided by the comparison of temporal and spatial velocity power spectra with spatially filtered direct numerical simulation data, enabling an estimation of the effective noise-limited spatial and temporal dynamic range of the present experimental measurement. Space-time correlations and phase-spectra are used to estimate the mean and streamwise wave-number dependent convection velocities at various heights above the wall. Results reveal convection velocities greater than the local mean velocity in the lower log layer, decreasing to a level 3.5 % lower than the mean velocity in the upper log and wake regions. The convection velocity is shown to depend on the streamwise length scale and is found to decrease at higher wave-numbers for all wall-normal locations. Comparison between the measured and reconstructed spatial fields show that Taylor's hypothesis can only be applied over short streamwise distances of less than 1$\delta$ in the buffer and inner log-layer, while larger projection distances (≥3$\delta$) are possible in the outer-log and wake region of the turbulent boundary layer.},

abstract = {Copyright {\textcopyright} DCDSB. 2015. The stability of an equilibrium point of a nonlinear dynamical system is typically determined using Lyapunov theory. This requires the construction of an energy-like function, termed a Lyapunov function, which satisfies certain positivity conditions. Unlike linear dynamical systems, there is no algorithmic method for constructing Lyapunov functions for general nonlinear systems. However, if the systems of interest evolve according to polynomial vector fields and the Lyapunov functions are constrained to be sum-of-squares polynomials then stability verification can be cast as a semidefinite (convex) optimization programme. In this paper we describe recent advances in sumofsquares programming that facilitate advanced stability analysis and control design.},

In this respect, we introduce barrier functionals, which are functionals of the dependent and independent variables.

We focus on flows that are spatially invariant in one direction and whose base flow can be described by a polynomial, e.g. streamwise-constant channel, Couette and pipe flows. Our methodology is based on the notion of dissipation inequalities in control theory and provides a single unified approach for examining flow properties such as energy growth, worst-case disturbance amplification and stability to persistent excitations (i.e. input-to-state stability). It also enables direct analysis of the nonlinear partial differential equation rather than of a discretized form of the equations, thereby removing the possibility of truncation errors. We demonstrate how to numerically compute the input–output properties of the flow as the solution of a (convex) optimization problem. We apply our theoretical and computational tools to plane Couette, channel and pipe flows.

abstract = {Sum of squares optimization is an active area of research at the interface of algorithmic algebra and convex optimization. Over the last decade, it has made significant impact on both discrete and continuous optimization, as well as several other disciplines, notably control theory. A particularly exciting aspect of this research area is that it leverages classical results from real algebraic geometry, some dating back to prominent mathematicians like Hilbert. Yet, it offers a modern, algorithmic viewpoint on these concepts, which is amenable to computation and deeply rooted in semidefinite programming. In this lecture, we give an introduction to sum of squares optimization focusing as much as possible on aspects relevant to ORF523, namely, complexity and interplay with convex optimization. A presentation of this length is naturally incomplete. The interested reader is referred to a very nice and recent edited volume by Blekherman, Parrilo, and Thomas, the PhD thesis of Parrilo or his original paper, the independent papers by Lasserre and by Nesterov, the paper by Shor (translated from Russian), and the survey papers by Laurent and by Reznick. Much of the material below can be found in these references. Polynomial Optimization For the purposes of this lecture, we motivate the sum of squares machinery through the polynomial optimization problem: minimize p(x) subject to x ∈ K := {x ∈ R n | g i (x) ≥ 0, h i (x) = 0}, (1) where p, g i , and h i are multivariate polynomials. A set defined by a finite number of polynomial inequalities (such as the set K above) is called basic semialgebraic. Of course, we can write K with polynomial inequalities only (by replacing h i (x) = 0 with h i (x) ≥ 0 and −h i (x) ≥ 0), or (unlike the case of linear programming) with polynomial equalities only (by replacing g i (x) ≥ 0 with g i (x) − z 2 i = 0, for some new variables z i). We prefer, however, to keep the general form above since we will later treat polynomial inequalities and equalities slightly differently. The special case of problem (1) where the polynomials p, g i , h i all have degree one is of course linear programming, which we can solve in polynomial time. Unfortunately though, as we will review in the complexity section of these notes below, the problem quickly becomes intractable when the degrees increase from one ever so slightly. For example, unconstrained minimization of a quartic polynomial, minimization of a cubic polynomial over the sphere, or minimization of a quadratic polynomial over the simplex are all NP-hard. The sum of squares methodology offers a hierarchy of polynomially sized semidefinite program-ming relaxations to cope with this computational intractability. It is quite different in philosophy from the approach taken by, say, the descent methods in nonlinear optimization. In particular, it 1},

abstract = {The progress in our understanding of several aspects of turbulent Rayleigh-B{\'{e}}nard convection is reviewed. The focus is on the question of how the Nusselt number and the Reynolds number depend on the Rayleigh number Ra and the Prandtl number Pr, and on how the thicknesses of the thermal and the kinetic boundary layers scale with Ra and Pr. Non-Oberbeck-Boussinesq effects and the dynamics of the large scale convection roll are addressed as well. The review ends with a list of challenges for future research on the turbulent Rayleigh-B{\'{e}}nard system.},

abstract = {Coherent structures in wall turbulence transport momentum and provide a means of producing turbulent kinetic energy. Above the viscous wall layer, the hairpin vortex paradigm of Theodorsen coupled with the quasistreamwise vortex paradigm have gained considerable support from multidimensional visualization using particle image velocimetry and direct numerical simulation experiments. Hairpins can autogenerate to form packets that populate a significant fraction of the boundary layer, even at very high Reynolds numbers. The dynamics of packet formation and the ramifications of organization of coherent structures (hairpins or packets) into larger-scale structures are discussed. Evidence for a large-scale mechanism in the outer layer suggests that further organization of packets may occur on scales equal to and larger than the boundary layer thickness.},
